            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "short_description": "What\u2019s up at the stock market? A rebuttal  Profit by Pakistan Today",
            "text": "On 14th December, a leading English newspaper published an opinion piece by the title \u201cWhat\u2019s up at the stock market?\u201d The fact that the write-up showed little understanding of the stock market needs no mention. But it becomes alarming when an attempt is made to understand a larger-than-life scenario in a few words. It would be like trying to write a page length summary of War and Peace expecting to get all the nuance and significance of the literary masterpiece.\n\nWhat is in the op-ed?\n\nLet\u2019s start off by trying to understand what the writer has tried to say. The writer admits outright that he rarely writes about the stock market and that he has a pessimistic view even when he does write. This already sets the expectation that he is not going to laud the market for its recent rally.\n\nThe skepticism shown here is warranted to an extent. Too many times in the past, the rally and gains in the stock market have been artificial in nature and have left retail investors holding the short end of the stick. This publication recently did a series on the three stock market crashes seen in a span of nine years at the Karachi Stock Exchange.\n\nSo it is no surprise that the op-ed\u2019s central theme is that the current rise needs to be seen with some suspicion. The rise is seen as being made up of 22,500 points which have primarily been made up of two sectors: banking and energy, where energy includes the fertiliser sector. Banks and energy have a high weightage in the KSE 100 index, and as these companies will see an increase, so will the index.\n\nIs the increase justified by the rise in earnings of these two sectors? The writer highlights the fact that out of Rs 417 billion of profits after tax seen for the first quarter, more than a third are from banks totalling Rs 149 billion, while Rs 30 billion are from oil marketing companies alone. Even based on their past results, this is a huge increase for both sectors. Banks have earned due to high interest rates, while oil marketing companies have profited from the depreciating currency and inventory gains.\n\nThe op-ed also mentions this idea of the \u2018bad broker\u2019, who is seen as being an agent of only a few clients and high net worth individuals. He is responsible for pumping the market in the direction which one or two clients want, while the broker is able to disadvantage all his remaining clientele to benefit a few. There is little economic relevance to the market turning the corner \u2013 instead, it is funded by a few brokers and their clients.\n\nWhat is not in the op-ed?\n\nThe writer leaves out some key insights from his piece which need to be mentioned.\n\nFirst, let us address the earnings question. As mentioned earlier, banks have earned due to high interest rates, while oil marketing companies have profited from the depreciating currency and inventory gains. The writer is correct in regards to the main factor behind the earnings of these two sectors \u2013 but there is a need to widen the scope of the study. The market has still seen a further rise in profits, and the writer fails to take into account the other Rs 238 billion that have been earned in after tax profits. These make up more than 57% of the remaining profits.\n\nSecondly, and more importantly, let us examine the short-term view. It is true that the market has increased from 40,000 points on June 23, 2023 to 66,500 on December 12, 2023, which is an increase of 66.3%. Out of this total increase, 45% is contributed by the banking and energy sector including the fertilizer sector. The remaining 21% has come from the remaining index constituents. Is the writer correct?\n\nNot quite. The KSE 100 index is weighted in such a manner which means that 60% of the weightage is given to the banking and energy sector while the remaining is made up by the rest of the index. This would mean that when index increases by 100 points, 60 points are expected to come from these two sectors while the remaining will come from the other companies. When things are put in that context, it can be expected that the whole index has gained and rather than just a few sectors, the whole index has seen an increase.\n\nWhat is the analysis company wise? Considering the increase seen in individual shares, 18 companies have seen an increase of more than 70% which are part of the banking and energy sector in the period analysed. An additional piece of information that is needed here is the fact that there are also 16 other index constituents which have seen an increase of more than 70% which are not part of these sectors.\n\nCompany Sector Weightage Return K-Electric Limited Energy 0.70% 176.83% Service Industries Limited Leather & Tanneries 0.65% 166.30% Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited Fertilizer 0.64% 155.70% National Refinery Limited Energy 0.41% 150.63% Pak Elektron Limited Cable & Electric 0.50% 148.46% Interloop Limited Textile 0.90% 116.68% Bank AL Habib Limited Bank 2.68% 112.70% Attock Refinery Limited Energy 0.66% 108.41% Pakistan State Oil Company Limited Energy 1.98% 107.88% Askari Bank Limited Bank 0.49% 106.27% Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited Bank 1.19% 106.25% International Steels Limited Steel 0.54% 105.62% International Industries Limited Engineering 0.43% 105.57% Thal Limited Auto 0.52% 105.26% Meezan Bank Limited Bank 3.32% 104.55% Pakistan Petroleum Limited Energy 3.79% 104.04% Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited Paper & Board 0.68% 94.51% National Bank of Pakistan Bank 0.83% 93.89% Unity Foods Limited Food & Personal Care 0.49% 91.31% Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd IT 0.41% 90.81% The Bank of Punjab Bank 0.50% 89.66% The Hub Power Company Limited Energy 5.42% 87.89% Pak-Gulf Leasing Company Limited Financial Services 0.00% 83.45% Habib Bank Limited Bank 3.38% 81.49% Cnergyico PK Limited Energy 0.46% 79.57% Bank Alfalah Limited Bank 1.67% 79.34% Kohinoor Textile Mills Limited Textile 0.23% 79.13% Yousaf Weaving Mills Limited Textile 0.01% 76.32% Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited Energy 1.02% 74.15% Pakistan International Bulk Terminal Transport 0.30% 73.57% Standard Chartered Bank (Pak) Ltd Bank 0.32% 73.10% Frieslandcampina Engro Pakistan Limited Food & Personal Care 0.33% 72.58% Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited Financial Services 0.27% 71.14% Fauji Cement Company Limited Cement 0.80% 71.08%\n\nSimilarly, once accounting for weightages, 23 companies from the banking and energy sector contributed more than 0.5% each and 13 other companies also increased by more than 0.5% each. In short, it can be seen that it is not only these two sectors which have contributed to the gain but other sectors have also contributed to the increase.\n\nCompany Sector Weightage Return Weighted Return The Hub Power Company Limited Energy 5.42% 87.89% 4.76% Pakistan Petroleum Limited Energy 3.79% 104.04% 3.94% Meezan Bank Limited Bank 3.32% 104.55% 3.47% Bank AL Habib Limited Bank 2.68% 112.70% 3.02% Habib Bank Limited Bank 3.38% 81.49% 2.75% United Bank Limited Bank 3.99% 68.02% 2.71% Oil & Gas Development Company Limited Energy 3.72% 68.20% 2.54% MCB Bank Limited Bank 3.56% 68.74% 2.45% Pakistan State Oil Company Limited Energy 1.98% 107.88% 2.14% Lucky Cement Limited Cement 3.46% 57.58% 1.99% Millat Tractors Limited Auto 2.55% 64.47% 1.64% Engro Fertilizers Limited Fertilizer 3.11% 43.33% 1.35% Bank Alfalah Limited Bank 1.67% 79.34% 1.32% Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited Bank 1.19% 106.25% 1.26% K-Electric Limited Energy 0.70% 176.83% 1.24% Mari Petroleum Company Limited Energy 2.61% 44.34% 1.16% Engro Corporation Limited Fertilizer 3.98% 27.37% 1.09% Service Industries Limited Leather & Tanneries 0.65% 166.30% 1.08% Interloop Limited Textile 0.90% 116.68% 1.05% Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited Fertilizer 0.64% 155.70% 1.00% Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited Fertilizer 3.83% 23.83% 0.91% Colgate-Palmolive (Pakistan) Limited FMCG 1.82% 49.68% 0.90% National Bank of Pakistan Bank 0.83% 93.89% 0.78% Dawood Hercules Corporation Limited Fertilizer 2.01% 38.16% 0.77% Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited Energy 1.02% 74.15% 0.76% Pak Elektron Limited Cable & Electric 0.50% 148.46% 0.74% Attock Refinery Limited Energy 0.66% 108.41% 0.72% Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited Paper & Board 0.68% 94.51% 0.64% National Refinery Limited Energy 0.41% 150.63% 0.62% Systems Limited IT 3.60% 16.35% 0.59% International Steels Limited Steel 0.54% 105.62% 0.57% Fauji Cement Company Limited Cement 0.80% 71.08% 0.57% D.G.

From the period of June till December, there were 48 companies which saw a return of more than 100%. Banking and energy only made up 10 of these companies while the remaining were companies that trade on the stock market but are not part of the KSE 100 index..\n\nThe writer posits that most of the index has seen a rise which is based on just two sectors. But in fact the stock market has actually seen a much wider sale increase in both index related and shares not part of the index.\n\nThis can lead to additional worries of bubbles being created, and that can be addressed with mechanisms developed by the stock exchange. However, this does not mean that the index has only increased due to movement in these two sectors.\n\nThe evil stockbroker\n\nThe second part of the op-ed deals with the notion that the evil stock brokers are able to dictate the movement of shares. These are stock brokers who are able to game the system for some of their clients, and benefit a few among them.\n\nI strongly disagree with this notion. The fact of the matter is that no broker in the market is so large that he can cause and sustain a rally of this magnitude for this long. As already shown, the movement is taking place all across the board and no broker has the resources to be able to lead to such a sustained rally by themself. Even if they are able to join forces, they still do not have the capital to be able to lead to a rally like the one seen recently.\n\nEven if it is agreed upon that clients are being disadvantaged by selling snake oil to smaller investors, how is this model sustainable? Once this rally is over, and one is able to dupe retail investors in losing their money, how will the broker sustain himself in the future?\n\nHere, let us recap what the market is and who its participants are. On the face of it, the market is made up of buyers and sellers. In order to buy from the market, there has to be someone who is willing to sell their shares.\n\nBut it is important to understand who is buying and who is selling. Pakistan is able to get investments from outside its own borders where foreigners can trade in the stock market. This is known as Foreign Investors Portfolio Investments (FIPI). Similarly, when local investors invest in the market, these are known as Local Investors Portfolio Investment (LIPI). Both these categories are made up of individuals and corporations who invest and divest their shares in the market. In terms of LIPI, trade data is also broken down for individuals, companies, banks, non-banking financial companies, mutual funds, brokers themselves, insurance companies and other organizations that might wish to invest in the stock market.\n\nThe trade data for FIPI from June 23, 2023 to December 15, 2023 shows that foreigners were net buyers of $72 million. This means that foreign investors, who have their own research to back their decision making of investment, invested in the market. Brokers can have the best manipulative powers in the world but to make a foreign investor fall for your trap would seem highly unlikely. Foreign investors have a long term view towards investment and have to justify their investment rather than say \u2018the broker asked me to invest\u2019.\n\nIn terms of LIPI, most of the buying was carried out by companies and insurance companies, while individuals and brokers sold their shares. Again, seeing only the sale would point towards shares being offloaded but the shares were bought by companies and insurance companies who have investment committee and advisory bodies who dictate how investment has to be carried out. The investment committees have to rationalize every investment decision before they follow through on it.\n\nThe need for a better understanding\n\nIt might seem like a good idea to have someone to blame and someone to target when a rally is going on in the market. After all, if an asset bubble is being created, the best course of action would be to point it out to investors beforehand.\n\nThe problem begins when an incomplete picture is used to make a judgment. Just like the tail of three blind men seeing something different rather than the elephant in the room, there is a need to take all factors into consideration before a judgment is made.\n\nThe real winners, losers and the one left \u2018holding the bag\u2019 will be revealed in due time. Even I don\u2019t feign to know the actual reasons behind this rally and am able to separate the fact from fiction. However, the op-ed feels like a knee jerk reaction on the basis of few facts, and it fails to take into account all factors relevant in this rally. This rebuttal is a small attempt to provide some reason to the recent rise.",

The bank\u2019s provision for bad loans decreased 18.4 percent to Rs1.78 billion.\n\nSoneri Bank\u2019s profit surges threefold in 2023\n\nSoneri Bank Limited (SNBL) on Wednesday reported a more than threefold increase in its annual profit for 2023, boosted by higher interest income and lower provisions.\n\nThe bank posted a net profit of Rs6.08 billion, or Rs5.51 per share, for the year ended Dec. 31, 2023, compared with Rs1.88 billion, or Rs1.71 per share, a year earlier.\n\nThe board of directors declared a final cash dividend of Rs3 per share for 2023, the bank said in a filing to the PSX.\n\nSoneri Bank's net interest income rose by 102 percent to Rs22.76 billion in 2023, from Rs11.27 billion in 2022, as interest-earning assets grew by 55.5 percent to Rs98.03 billion.\n\nThe bank's total non-markup income, which includes fees, commissions and foreign exchange income, increased by 25.2 percent to Rs6.46 billion in 2023, from Rs5.16 billion in 2022.\n\nThe bank also reversed provisions of Rs1.39 billion in 2023, compared with an expense of Rs374.57 million in 2022, as it improved its asset quality and recoveries.\n\nThe bank's total non-markup expenses, which include administrative and operating costs, rose by 26.4 percent to Rs15.47 billion in 2023, from Rs12.24 billion in 2022, mainly due to inflation and business expansion.",

            "text": "ISLAMABAD, Oct 10 (APP):In an exciting development for the capital markets and the economy as a whole, the Pakistan Stock Exchange announced the much-awaited list of the Top 25 Companies Awards recipients for the year 2022.\n\nThese are the most prestigious and coveted awards in the corporate sector and were initiated by the Exchange in 1978, according to a news release here on Tuesday.\n\nThe selected companies have excelled on the basis of their financial performance, governance, and operational achievements, as well as sustainability and ESG-related initiatives. They truly are leaders in all respects in Pakistan\u2019s corporate sector.\n\nThe PSX Top 25 Companies Awards recognize companies achieving certain key pre-requisites for this prestigious award, which include having a minimum dividend distribution of 30 percent and shares of the company having been traded at least 75 percent of the total trading days in a year, among other pre-requisites.\n\nSubject to achieving these pre-requisites, the companies are further weighed based on certain quantitative and qualitative criteria. In terms of quantitative criteria, PSX selects listed companies which have performed exceptionally in the context of profitability ratios, dividend related ratios, and turnover of shares, among other specifics.\n\nIn terms of qualitative criteria, PSX selected high-performing listed companies based on corporate social responsibility (CSR), reporting on SDGs, ESG-related initiatives, and diversity and inclusivity, among other considerations.\n\nAnnouncing the PSX Top 25 Companies names for 2022, the MD and CEO of PSX, Farrukh H. Khan, stated, \u201cOn behalf of the Pakistan Stock Exchange, I extend my warmest congratulations to the recipients of the PSX Top 25 Companies Awards 2022. In the current challenging economic circumstances, the announcement of the PSX Top 25 Companies Awards is very welcome news\u201d.\n\nHe said these awards showcase the best of Pakistan\u2019s corporate, business, and industrial companies. He is confident that this will send a strong message to investors locally as well as globally that Pakistan\u2019s economy does indeed consist of companies that not only outshine others locally but are comparable to the best companies internationally as well.\n\nThese companies deserve even more credit this year, as does the corporate sector overall, since they have performed exceptionally well in a difficult and challenging economic environment, he added. As in previous years, PSX plans to host an event to celebrate and commemorate these companies.\n\nThe companies that made it to the Top 25 Companies Awards list in 2022, in order of their ranking includes Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited, Engro Corporation Limited, Systems Limited, Engro Fertilizers Limited, Engro Powergen Qadirpur Limited, Engro Polymer & Chemicals Limited, Security Papers Limited, Habib Bank Limited,Pakistan Oilfields Limited, Bank Alfalah Limited, Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited, Millat Tractors Limited, Mari Petroleum Company Limited, Cherat Cement Company Limited, United Bank Limited, Archroma Pakistan Limited, International Industries Limited, MCB Bank Limited, Lotte Chemical Pakistan Limited, Indus Motor Company Limited, Jubilee Life Insurance Company Limited, Pakistan Cables Limited, The Hub Power Company Limited, Cherat Packaging Limited, Pakistan State Oil Company Limited.",

            "text": "The Bank of Khyber (PSX: BOK) announced on Friday that it will set up a wholly-owned Exchange Company with an initial paid-up capital of up to Rs1 billion.\n\nIn a stock filing on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), the BOK stated that its board had approved the establishment of an exchange company during their meeting held on November 03, 2023.\n\nHowever, the board\u2019s decision is subject to approval and clearance by the SBP and the completion of other regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nRead This: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nBOK\u2019s initiative is a crucial component of a wider campaign by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) aimed at curbing illicit activities within the underground market.\n\nThe SBP has recently introduced structural reforms within the exchange company sector to enhance regulatory oversight, bolster governance frameworks, fortify internal controls, and tighten compliance protocols.\n\nFurthermore, the SBP has raised the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional stipulation that the capital must be unencumbered by prior losses.\n\nEarlier, major banks including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), Bank Alfalah (BAFL), Habib Metropolitan Bank, Askari Bank Limited and Bank of Punjab announced their plans to establish their own forex companies.\n\nThe SBP issued no-objection certificate (NOC) to ABL and MCB for establishing their exchange companies. Allied Bank\u2019s exchange company will be named ABL Exchange Company (Private) Limited and MCB\u2019s as MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

            "short_description": "Ten years ago Chenab Limited defaulted on its loans. Now it looks towards second act  Profit by Pakistan Today",
            "text": "This is the story of a rise, a fall, and possibly a second act. Over the past fifteen years the Chenab Group has faced a gamut of challenges. Once one of the largest exporters in Pakistan, and owner of the popular ChenOne stores locally, they faced consistent losses as the country\u2019s textile industry suffered in the aftermath of the 2008 energy and financial crises.\n\nMany waited and watched to see when Chenab and its owner, Mian Muhammad Latif, would call it quits. However, either completely through an act of inertia or through sheer determination, somehow the vertically integrated textile exporter clung on. And now an opportunity may just have presented itself from unlikely quarters.\n\nThe company has been given some quarter to breathe thanks to its lenders. Amongst them, HBL was Chenab\u2019s biggest lender. And now the bank is spearheading the restructuring of the company\u2019s Rs 10 billion overdue debt to the banking sector.\n\nThere seems to be belief within HBL that the Chenab Group will succeed in turning their company around. Where does this faith come from? It might have something to do with the company\u2019s origins and its history.\n\nBig dreams\n\nWe start off in Toba Tek Singh. With a young man and a big dream. Mian Latif was the son of a leading cotton industrialist. Latif\u2019s family had come to Toba Tek Singh back in 1883 and were agriculturalists. In small towns like Toba Tek Singh, land-owning farmers realised cotton was an important crop for the ruling British Empire. And for much of his childhood Latif saw as his family\u2019s fortunes grew. Within the tiny agricultural community, cotton farming and ginning were lucrative businesses. Mian Latif\u2019s family were large landholders in Toba Tek Singh, a district roughly halfway between Faisalabad and Multan.\n\nBut as a young man Mian Latif\u2019s ambition lay far beyond Toba Tek Singh. In the 1970s many of Punjab\u2019s large rural land holding families were making a transition: moving their main source of wealth away from farming the cotton \u2013 and other crops, such as sugar \u2013 and towards setting up the industrial units that would process and sell finished goods. And for this purpose Mian Latif, along with three of his brothers, set his eyes on Lyallpur.\n\nThe city had still not been dubbed Faisalabad when Mian Latif first started establishing a business there in 1973. At the time the city was still developing and far from the industrial hub it is today. But Latif had a belief that his family\u2019s future lay in manufacturing textiles rather than just farming and selling cotton. Remember, the 1970s were marked by mass nationalisation. The independence of Bangladesh in 1971 also meant Pakistan lost many of its industrial units and there were no exports to speak of.\n\nLatif set about establishing a production unit which could not only manufacture but also export. The company started off by producing textile goods for the local market. In 1985 they began exporting goods starting from the Far East from where they moved to Europe and then USA, eventually exporting goods to around 42 countries.\n\nEvents leading up to the crisis\n\nTo understand the downfall of the company, it is important to understand the time leading up to the crisis. In 1999, when Gen Musharraf took power in a military coup, the Chenab Group was still a lower middle-market business in terms of size. And ChenOne at the time only had three stores, though its fourth store opened up in Karachi that year. During the Musharraf Administration, however, as the government privatised the banks and encouraged private sector lending, particularly for industrial growth projects, the Chenab Group started expanding aggressively. For the financial year ending June 30, 2001, Chenab Ltd, the group\u2019s main publicly listed company, had revenues of Rs340 crores. Over the next six years, the company more than doubled its revenue, ending the financial year 2007 with Rs816 crores in revenue, which represents an average annual growth rate of 15.7%. At one point in time, the company was making $30 million worth of exports on a monthly basis and employed 12,000 people.\n\nThat growth, however, was fueled largely by debt. In 2001, the company had just under Rs70 crores in long-term debt. By 2007, that number had ballooned to Rs332 crores, a nearly five times increase. Yet cash flows were not keeping pace: Chenab Ltd\u2019s net income in 2007 was just Rs7.5 crores, even less than the Rs13 crores it had earned in 2001.\n\nYet the group kept expanding, particularly its retail chain, which opened up more stores throughout urban Pakistan, particularly in the smaller metropolitan areas of Punjab, where it took to developing not just its own stores, but large shopping malls and complexes under the name ChenOne Tower. The first ChenOne Tower opened in 2005 in Multan, followed by another in Sargodha, which finally opened in 2009.\n\nAt the same time, even though the company was growing, stiff competition from China and India was being faced. These countries were providing subsidies to the textile industry while Pakistan had no such programme for its own industry. Not at the same scale, at least.\n\nIn domestic terms, the finance costs were already ramping up as interest rates were being used to address inflation which were also being translated to higher energy and labour costs. Even though profitability was down, it was expected that as the conditions would improve, the company would be able to rebound.\n\nThe crisis sets in\n\nThe year 2008 was supposed to be a stellar year, in terms of sales, for the company as it had already forecasted sales of more than Rs. 800 crores for the year. The company was able to earn revenues of Rs. 850 crores but it was the first year in decades that the company made a loss.\n\nThe cause for this was two events. First of all, the country started to see wide scale gas and electricity load shedding which forced production to slow down and created an added pressure on the costs being incurred. In addition to that, the assasination of Benazir Bhutto saw the whole country shut down. With railway lines and road infrastructure being impacted, exports stopped with containers waiting at the ports for days.\n\nBetween 2007-8 Pakistan was hit by the global recession. The textile industry faced challenges due to high energy costs, rupee depreciation vis-\u00e0-vis the US $ and other currencies, and a high cost of doing business. As a result, there was a reduction in the number of textile mills operating in the country from about 450 units in 2009 to 400 units in 2019. This decrease has simultaneously seen the domestic demand for cotton dip in the country.\n\nThe ethos of the company became a haunting call as the company was not able to follow through on its promise of commitment. Rising costs and fall in revenues were already having an impact on the company. However, something much more damaging was also taking place. Clients were not getting their orders and the trust that had been built bit by bit over years came crashing down in a matter of days.\n\nLatif himself explains the situation thusly. \u201cThe trust we had built with the clients is built inch by inch. When it comes down, it comes down in meters.\u201d\n\nThe loss of brand name and image for clients was going to have a devastating impact on the future revenues of the company and would have a long lasting effect. The period from 2009 to 2014 saw the company face consistent losses. The inertia built into the system saw sales of Rs. 900 crores in 2009 decline to only Rs. 220 crores by 2014.\n\nAs the losses started to accumulate, the equity of the company turned negative in 2011 and stood at minus Rs. 400 crores in 2014. In real terms, the company saw a loss of Rs. 730 crores in a span of 5 years which comes to around average annual losses of Rs 150 crores per year.\n\nThe impact of losses had a two fold impact on the company. At one hand, the company relied on taking on more debt in order to fund its working capital requirements in order to carry out some form of manufacturing. Even though orders had fallen, still the company needed to make sure it could retain some form of exports to the clients who had still stuck with the company. The company hit its lowest point when, in 2014, it announced that it would not be able to pay back its debt obligations which led to many of the creditors filing recovery proceedings against the company.\n\nAs the case proceedings started, Latif still felt that his dream should not die. Even in the darkest times, he had the belief that given the right support and resources, his dream will become reality once again.\n\nIn 2017, the Lahore High Court asked winding up proceedings to be initiated against the company in order to allow the banks to sell the assets of the company and get back some of their money. This would have felt like the end of a journey that started 43 years ago. Latif still persevered and fought. The case was litigated to the fullest extent and in 2021, the court reversed its winding up orders. The company was going to be allowed to operate once again.\n\nThe unlikely hero\n\nIn many ways Chenab is not unique. Like many of Pakistan\u2019s upper middle-market companies \u2013 the ones just on the cusp of being large but not quite \u2013 Chenab tried to grow too fast with too much debt during the easy money era of the Musharraf years, and crashed hard after the financial crisis of 2008, and has yet to recover since. Yet unlike some of the other financial carcasses of the 2008 crash, the owners of Chenab have continued to try to revive their business.\n\nIt has perhaps been that tenacity that is now paying off. After some favourable bankruptcy case rulings in the Lahore High Court (LHC) back in 2020, the company has now found an ally in HBL. At this point, there were 22 creditors who had lent to the company. Among the biggest lenders was HBL. In such dire circumstances, HBL provided an opportunity for the company to get back up on its feet.\n\nHBL spearheaded the effort to consolidate the total debt of the company and to restructure its short term borrowings to allow it to convert them all into long term liabilities. With assurances from the bank, the company felt that it could regain its lost glory and attain the heights that it once had.\n\nThe bank has also provided much needed backing to the ailing company. The Rs. 9.5 billion debt was restructured for a period of 14 years. The bank believed in the fact that once the company was given an infusion of fresh financing, it would be used to fund the working capital requirements of the company. This would allow the company to meet its current orders and any excess capacity could be used to further broaden its sales and profits.\n\nIn addition to the banks restructuring the loan, the directors of the company gave a loan of Rs. 42 crore and 50 lakhs to the company and it was decided to sell some of the non core assets of the company in order to fund the working capital requirements.\n\nThe restructuring plan\n\nBased on the court filings, Chenab Limited contested that it will execute a revival plan for the company and its competitors in order to turn the company around. The courts had already ordered winding up proceedings to be started against the company on the back of recovery lawsuits filed by some of the creditors. The Chenab Group felt that in order to put any plan into action, the first step was to get a stay on the winding up proceedings. Habib Bank, the largest creditor, joined together with some of the other creditors to provide some breathing space to the company.\n\nChenab group had short term loans of Rs. 4.3 billion while its long terms loans stood at Rs. 5.1 billion. From this, Rs. 1.7 billion was held by Habib bank followed by United bank held Rs 1.3 billion, Bank of Punjab held Rs. 1.2 billion and Askari and Allied Bank holding Rs. 1.4 billion collectively. In addition to that, the Group also owed to an additional 17 banks and financial institutions namely BankIslami, National Bank of Pakistan, Albaraka Bank, Habib Metropolitan Bank, Silkbank, Standard Chartered Bank, MCB Bank, Citibank, Faysal Bank, Saudi Pak Industrial and Agriculture Investment Company, Pak Oman Investment Company, First Punjab Modaraba, Pak Libya Holding Company, Pak Kuwait Investment Company, Orix Leasing and Orix Investment Bank, First Credit and Investment Bank and First National Bank Modaraba.\n\nThe total debt of the company was going to be divided into two parts as Tier I and Tier II with both tiers having an amount of Rs. 4.7 billion each. The Tier I loan was going to be paid over 30 quarterly installments which would elapse a time period of 7 and a half years and would start from the time the proposal was sanctioned and put into place. Once the Tier I loans were paid off, the amount owed to Tier II would be paid off over a period of 6 and a half years with 26 quarterly installments.\n\nThe markup on the loan was set at 5 percent per annum for Tier I initially while during this time the Tier II will accrue markup at 3 percent until the Tier I loan was paid off. Once this was done, the markup on the Tier II loan would also rise to 5 percent until all of it was paid off.\n\nIn addition to that, the family also sold a third of its holdings of 60% to an investor in order to meet their working capital needs at a rate of Rs. 15.2 per share. This investment totalled to around Rs. 35 crore of additional funding which was used towards the company and its restructuring. The company also committed to selling some of its non-core assets which were expected to raise Rs 1.4 billion which would be used to pay off some of its loans while also look to meet the working capital requirements of the company.\n\nLooking towards the future\n\nThe company seems to have turned the page. In the last 18 months, the company has been able to earn Rs. 2.5 billion in revenue and has hired 3,000 of its former employees back. It is a blessing for the 3,000 households whose futures and hopes are now attached with the future of the company again.\n\nFrom the total loan of Rs. 9.5 billion, the company has already paid back Rs. 1 billion and expects to keep on track of the Agreement that has been made with the banks. This mirrors Latif\u2019s words when he says that \u201cWe will give every drop of blood but will follow through on our commitment.\u201d\n\nAn important fact that needs to be mentioned here is that, even though the company has been following the payment plan that has been agreed upon, the company according to Latif is yet to reach profitability. The performance of the last 18 months has shown promise, but the company still needs some time before they turn profitable in the long run. In addition to that, the company is a listed company and was trading in the stock exchange, however, as it has not filed its annual accounts, it was delisted and put into the default counter. The company is correcting that by publishing some of its financial statements and the latest accounts that can be accessed are from 2021.",
