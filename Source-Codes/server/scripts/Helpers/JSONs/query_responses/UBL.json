            "text": "KARACHI: The stock market started trading on a bullish note on the first day of the week but the growing political uncertainty and its likely fallouts triggered selling by some worried investors as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed in the red.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the equities floated in both directions. Initially, the index made an intraday high of 555 points to 65,069 level. However, profit-taking at the aforesaid level compelled the benchmark index to lose earlier gains before recording an intraday low of 331 points to 64,184.\n\nDue to increasing political noise on the holding of upcoming general elections on Feb 8, investors opted to trim their equity positions by booking profit in selective stocks of banks, exploration and production, tech and OMC sectors.\n\nResultantly, United Bank Ltd, Pakistan Petro\u00adle\u00adum, Oil and Gas Develo\u00adpment Company Ltd, TRG Pakistan Ltd and PSO lost 200 points, cumulatively.\n\nOn the flip side, Engro Corporation, Engro Fertili\u00adsers Ltd and Dawood Hercules Corporation Ltd collectively added 269 points due to rejuvenated buying interest in them.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said pre-poll uncertainty ahead of the IMF board meeting, which is scheduled for Jan 11, on its first review under the $3bn Stand-By Arrangement did add to the investor nervousness.\n\nAlso, doubts were growing about a cut in the SBP policy rate in the wake of surging inflation and concerns for geo-political tensions played a catalyst role in the bearish close of the market.\n\nThe KSE-100 index closed at 64,237.03 points after losing 277.87 points or 0.43 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume plunged by 49.02pc to 484.01 million shares. The traded value also dipped 93.41pc to Rs12.74bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included K-Electric Ltd (168.81m shares), Worldcall Telecom Ltd (21.98m shares), Pakistan International Airlines Cor\u00adporation (17.94m shares), Pakistan Telecommuni\u00adcation Company Ltd (17.77m shares) and Cnergiyco PK Ltd (15.69m shares).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (Rs50.46), Reliance Cotton Spinning Mills Ltd (Rs35.00), JDW Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs33.69), Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs29.90) and Sapphire Textile Mills Ltd (Rs20.00).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs150.00), Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs135.00), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs22.60), Service Industries Ltd (Rs17.03) and Al-Abbas Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs13.00).\n\nForeign investors were net buyers as they purchased shares worth $0.16m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 9th, 2024",

            "text": "It started pretty much as a non-event. On the 20th of September the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), as part of its mundane routine, asked Pakistan Hotels Developers Limited (PHDL) what was going on with their stock price. The question was asked since PHDL, a publicly listed company that owns the Regent Plaza Hotel in Karachi, had been experiencing a surprising surge in its share price since the past two weeks.\n\nThe price had more than doubled from Rs 83 on the 6th of September to Rs 177 on the 20th of September. Any time there is a rise of this nature without any apparent reason, the PSX is supposed to ask the company if they know what is going on, and if there is any price-sensitive information that they have failed to release to the public. Companies almost always say that they have no clue why their share price is increasing, and usually that is the end of that.\n\nPrice-sensitive information is any information that, if disclosed, would most likely have an impact on the company\u2019s share price. For example, in the case of the PHDL, if their crown jewel, the Regent Plaza, was to go up for sale, the company would need to disclose this immediately, through a notification on the stock exchange.\n\nThere is wisdom to this. If, for example, company A comes in and wants to buy company B and pump money into it one would expect company B\u2019s stock price to go up. Now, this is information relevant to investors and as such company B must disclose it publicly via a notice to the stock exchange. This is because if they do not disclose it, the individuals that are in the loop regarding the deal will be able to buy shares in company B beforehand. When the information is finally disclosed the share price will most likely go up, and these individuals would benefit, but at the expense of those shareholders who sold their shares at lower prices being unaware of this price-sensitive information. This, of course, is what is called illegal insider trading.\n\nAnd that is exactly why the PSX followed procedures and inquired about the rise in share price from PHDL. The suspicion was that there might be some positive development that had led to an unusual increased interest in the shares of the company by some insiders.\n\nBut, as expected, on the morning of 22nd of September the company replied with an official sounding \u201cidk\u201d.\n\nHowever, despite the company stating that it had no price sensitive information to disclose, the share price continued its upward trajectory, going up by another 7.5% that day, the maximum allowed increase in a single day. Perhaps this was because, the company in the very same response also mentioned, in a very by-the-way manner, that there were parties that would off and on approach the company for buying their crown jewel, the Regent Plaza. However, it stated that no firm offer, that was also acceptable to the company, had been received so far, which is why they had not made any disclosures.\n\nThis was the first time the company had, albeit casually, informed the PSX that it was open to selling the Regent Plaza Hotel. Let that sink in. Any price-sensitive information is supposed to be intimated to the stock exchange. PHDL never told the exchange they had plans to sell, and yet through this notification informed them that they had at the very least received parties that were interested in buying the hotel.\n\nAnd it did not end there.\n\nThe very next working day, on Monday the 25th of September, PHDL announced that the Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT) had approached them over the weekend with an offer to buy the Regent Plaza, and that the potential buyer was interested in conducting a due-diligence of the property. Even more incredible? The notification claimed that SIUT had approached them a mere one day after PHDL claimed they had never been approached by a serious buyer up until that point.\n\nFollowing the official announcement that SIUT was indeed making an offer, for the next three weeks, the share price continued to increase by the maximum allowed 7.5%, every single day. When markets closed on Friday the 13th this month, the share price stood at a whopping Rs 523.1. This would mean that if someone would have started accumulating shares in PHDL between the 6th of September and the 25th of September, when the material information was publicly disclosed, they would have made a profit of over 500% in a month\u2019s time.\n\nAnd from the increased buying activity that took place during this period, one thing becomes clear: Someone had to be doing exactly that. A coincidence? Highly unlikely.\n\nThe more plausible answer is insider trading. As highlighted above, this occurs when any person that had prior knowledge of the deal starts buying shares at a time when the information is not available to the public. To understand if this was in fact a case of illegal insider trading, one must first answer a few questions:\n\nWhy would a company\u2019s share price go up if it is about to sell its main asset, which is akin to closing down the main business of the company? Should the share price not go down instead? What exactly does the law say about disclosing price-sensitive information? Is there any confusion in law and amongst market participants about what constitutes price-sensitive information and at what time it has to be disclosed? If such a case appears where there is such a discrepancy, what tools do the regulators have to establish if this was a case of insider trading or not? And if it was, what could have been the modus operandi to execute and hide the crime? And can the regulators find proof and narrow down who the suspects are?\n\nBusting white-collar crime is a tough gig. In Pakistan it seems the authorities have had a particularly hard time of it. In the case of Regent Plaza\u2019s sale to SIUT, let us start at the very beginning.\n\nA bit about PHDL\n\nLet\u2019s take a step back for a second. PHDL is a listed company that owns the Regent Plaza Hotel located on Shahrah-e-Faisal, Karachi. For years it has been in the hotel business and hasn\u2019t been doing particularly well. It made profits in some years but nothing compared to the assets on their balance sheet.\n\nThis is because PHDL has one very big and very fixed asset. The Regent Plaza Hotel accounts for a total of 97.7% of all assets that the company owns. In all companies, real estate is an asset that is regularly evaluated to reflect the real value of the asset in the financial statements.\n\nFor example, the fixed assets (basically The Regent Plaza Hotel) were worth Rs 2.4 billion in 2010 and in 2023 stand at close to Rs 10 billion due to it being revalued at market prices. Based on this increase in assets, the book value of PHDL\u2019s share should have gone from Rs 125 per share in 2010 to Rs. 542 per share in 2023.\n\nThe only problem is that since these assets are rising because of increasing property value, investors are not particularly interested. The value of the property is rising, but that does not mean profits are rising. Just look at the past few years. In the year 2020-21, the company recorded losses worth Rs 4.64 crore. In 2022-23 they made a profit of Rs 5.88 crores. While they did make a profit last year, remember this is a company with assets worth tens of billions of rupees. So even if PHDL made a profit of Rs 5 crore every year it would be a meagre utilisation of the value of the assets they own.\n\nInvestors are only interested in how well a company is doing, not the big fancy toys they own. Unless, of course, they are planning on selling those toys. If you are an investor in a company like PHDL, then shutting shop and selling the business is good news because you will make money. This is especially good if the company over the years had not been making any significant money off their assets.\n\nAnd since PHDL never expressed any interest in selling its properties, the value of the share remained low and steady. The share price has been trading between Rs. 20 and Rs. 160 from 2010 till August of 2023. The share price has been range bound between these two numbers and, regardless of performance, the share price has never broken past the Rs.160 mark.\n\nThat is until now.\n\nAs we\u2019ve mentioned above, the price was Rs. 83.5 when the market closed on 5th September 2023. Since then, the share price has rocketed to above Rs 500 after hitting upper lock on a nearly daily basis. This was strange. The company did not disclose any intention to sell, they did not announce that they were looking for buyers, or that anyone was interested in buying it. The stock price had remained steady for more than 13 years. And then in a matter of weeks it had ballooned. The only reasonable explanation for this can be that the company was planning on selling its real estate.\n\nThe problem is that there had been absolutely no indication as to such a sale. And since this is considered \u2018price-sensitive information\u2019 which is relevant to investors the PSX ended up asking PHDL. They in turn said they knew nothing about what was going on, with the caveat that they had on occasion been approached by potential buyers.\n\nAfter the reply was sent to PSX, the company sent out an announcement to PSX on 25th September 2023 that a potential buyer namely Sindh Institute of Urology and Transplantation (SIUT) Trust had approached the company through a letter dated September 23, 2023 and had shown interest in buying the hotel from the company. On 27th September, PHDL held its board of directors meeting and decided to provide hotel property documents to SIUT Trust to carry out their due diligence. On October 11th, the company disseminated the information that an offer for the property had been received and that an amount of Rs. 14.5 billion was being offered.\n\nThe impact of such an offer is going to be massive. As we have already seen, the hotel was valued at around Rs 10 billion by the company. Based on the Rs 10 billion number, the book value per share came to Rs. 542 per share. With an offer being made of Rs. 14.5 billion by the purchaser, the book value will further increase by 45% bringing the book value per share to around Rs. 786. As the book value of the shares would increase, the market value of the shares should settle around that point as well, assuming the sale goes through.\n\nThe share price reaching Rs. 786 would mean that there is a further upside potential of the price to increase by approx Rs. 300 or another 55-60%. If the initial price of Rs. 83 is taken, the total price increase would be 9.46 times or 946%.\n\nWhere was the regulator?\n\nThese are the moments that stock exchanges live for. There is nothing that should make a stock exchange suspicious like unusual activity. The PSX has a rule that in case there is any material information that has not been disclosed by the company, they should do so to explain, from their view, the sudden increase in price of the shares. The safeguards are in place specifically to prevent insider trading.\n\nThe law is pretty clear on these matters. Any and all information that is price-sensitive needs to be disclosed. That means if a company like the PHDL gets even a whiff of a sales offer, they need to disclose it immediately. Remember, when it comes to insider trading everyone is at risk. The insider could be an employee of either SIUT or PHDL that had knowledge about the deal being negotiated, it could have been a lawyer writing out the contracts, it could have been members on either one of the companies\u2019 boards, it could have been a secretary that was booking the conference room in which the two sides were meeting.\n\nThat is why it is so important to disclose this information. If it is anyone high ranking from PHDL or SIUT involved then it is a clear case of malicious intent to withhold information. In the case that it is some distant party using the information to make profits, PHDL sat and watched as the share price skyrocketed very quietly. They only responded when asked and even then made the very suspicious move of disclosing an offer to sell a day after denying any such offer existed.\n\nThe PSX makes a particular point of this. In fact, in July 2023 the stock exchange issued Guidance Notes to listed companies on continuous disclosure obligations under the PSX Regulations. The document was 18 pages of bullet points that can very easily be boiled down to one sentence: When in doubt, give more information than you think necessary. In short, to cover their tracks and be compliant, companies need to be proactive in giving out information.\n\nSo was this a case of insider trading and what can be done about it?\n\n\u201cAn increase in share price does not automatically imply that there has been insider trading or other market manipulation, however, the sharp increase in share price immediately before the announcement of a takeover bid raises red flags that need to be further investigated,\u201d says Haroon Baryalay, Managing Partner at FGE Ebrahim Hosain. \u201cWhether any insider trading has occurred or other market manipulation took place is something that will need to be determined based on the facts, which can only be decided after an investigation has been carried out.\u201d\n\nThere must have been a moment where the company\u2019s board made a decision that they intended to sell their hotel. This decision must have gone through a process of making the decision within the company before the intent was broadcasted outside. The question that needs to be asked of PHDL are around this.\n\nThe question is, will the PSX confront them on this now? And what tools do they have at their disposal?\n\n\u201cPlease be informed that the PSX has already taken cognizance of the unusual price movement in the share of PHDL. Any adverse findings as a result of the assessment shall be dealt with in accordance with the relevant provisions of the applicable laws. Rest assured, PSX is fully cognizant of its duty to ensure fair dealings and always takes measures to enhance transparency in the interest of investing public and market at large,\u201d a representative of the stock exchange said in response to Profit\u2019s query.\n\nSo what can be done?\n\nThe PSX actually has a number of options at its disposal. The stock exchange is just the frontline regulator of these matters. That means they are the ones that pick up on unusual activity and make inquiries into it. If they find that the answers from a company are not satisfactory, they have the option to go to the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) which is the apex regulator of all matters that have to deal with financial crimes.\n\nThe SECP is actually empowered to deal with these situations. All listed companies do provide details of the people they employ, board members are all known, and a lot can be done. The SECP initially makes inquiries. The commission has an \u201cACCESS TO INSIDE INFORMATION REGULATIONS, 2016\u201d which requires each listed company to appoint a senior manager to maintain a register with names of persons that have access to insider information. It should be possible to determine if the persons listed as insiders therein have been involved in any transactions in the weeks prior to the announcement of the acquisition. If so, this would be evidence of insider trading.\n\nIf an investigation is launched, they can approach the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to take charge. The FIA then can swoop in with some commando action. This means raids, seizing phones, pulling company records and doing a thorough forensic investigation into the matter. This is ideally how white collar crime should be dealt with.\n\nA complete audit needs to consider the accounts that were buying and selling the shares around these dates and see who the beneficial owners of these accounts are. It is important to carry out such an audit as it will show if the deal or even the knowledge of informal talks was leaked out beforehand. As the information was credible, people acted on it and made quick money once the deal would be made public. The PSX will do itself a favour by getting to the bottom of these trades and see if shareholders of the market were disadvantaged in any way.\n\nDuring these dates, two Negotiated Deal Market (NDM) trades were also carried out with Arif Habib Limited (TREC Holder Code 050) where 20,000 shares and 25,000 shares were bought outside of the regular market. Just based on current market price, these two trades made Rs. 13 million on just two trades as well. All these trades are suspect as they were carried out before the deal was announced formally.\n\nThe only problem is that Pakistan has generally had a hard time busting white collar crimes. Most crimes come out when it is too late. The SECP is empowered to investigate insider trading and were once actually quite active in issuing press releases when they busted someone. The problem is that the last time such a press release came out was way back in 2017. In fact back then two high profile cases had come out where high ranking officials of UBL and The Bank of Punjab had been caught being involved in insider trading. In the case of UBL, it had actually been their head of Investments.\n\nThe past six years have not seen any such action being taken, and there is a general understanding that insider trading can be undertaken relatively safely because the regulators have been a bit lax. But the very stark and obvious actions of PHDL make it seem like another press release from the SECP may be on the cards.",

This development knocked down the market\u2019s positive momentum with a feather.\n\nExploration and production, power, bank and fertiliser sectors contributed negatively to the index as Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, Hub Power, UBL and Engro Corporation lost 438 points, cumulatively.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said default risks amid political instability, policy uncertainty and massive gas price hike delivered by the ECC to meet an IMF deadline to recover an additional Rs242bn from gas consumers, mainly industries played a catalyst role in bearish close.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 61,020.06 points after tumbling by 1,133.78 points or 1.82 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume rose 13.57pc to 345.12 million shares.

            "text": "Pakistani stockbroker monitors the share prices during a trading session at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on November 7, 2023. \u2014 Online\n\nStocks fell for a third straight session on Wednesday, as political uncertainty and weak global cues weighed on investor sentiment, despite expectations of a rate cut after bond yields dropped at an auction.\n\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) benchmark KSE 100-share Index closed down by 170.13 points or 0.27 percent to 63,567.34 points, after touching a high of 64,043.87 and a low of 63,290.18 during the day. The KSE-30 index also closed flat with a decline of 1.67 points or 0.01 percent to 21,354.25 points.\n\n\"Stocks closed lower on geo-political uncertainty and political noise,\" said Ahsan Mehanti, an analyst at Arif Habib Corp.\n\nHe said a slump in global equities, weak oil prices and uncertainty over the central bank's key policy rate announcement this month played a catalytic role in the bearish close. Traded shares increased by 14 million shares to 421.331 million shares from 407.543 million shares. The trading value rose to Rs18.579 billion from Rs12.646 billion. Market capital narrowed to Rs9.310 trillion against Rs9.331 trillion. Out of 332 companies active in the session, 111 closed in green, 203 in red and 18 remained unchanged.\n\nAnalyst Ali Najib at Topline Securities said it was another day of bulls and bears rivalry. \u201cEquities moved in both directions as bullish and bearish forces confronted throughout the session to take the helm at PSX,\u201d Najib said.\n\n\u201cHowever, bears emerged as a winner as the KSE 100 index called the day at 63,567 levels (-170 points; down 0.67 percent).\u201d Investors switched between selective stocks of power, energy, fertilizer, auto, tech and cement sectors. Resultantly, HUBC, PPL, FFBL, MTL, TRG and LUCK lost 236 points, cumulatively. On the flip side, ENGRO, EFERT, MEBL and UBL collectively added 253 points as they witnessed rejuvenated buying interest.\n\nThe highest increase was recorded in Philip Morris (Pakistan) Limited, which rose by Rs51.24 to Rs734.50 per share, followed by Bata Pakistan Limited, which increased by Rs33 to Rs1,733 per share. A significant decline was noted in Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited, which fell by Rs401.50 to Rs8,801 per share, followed by Pak Suzuki Motor Company Limited, which closed lower by Rs53.74 to Rs662.77 per share.\n\nMuhammad Shuja Qureshi, an analyst at JS Research, said selling in the refinery sector dented the overall sentiment. \"In addition, selling continued in OGDC, PPL and PSO while buying was witnessed in selective stocks.\" \u201cA cautious stance is advised, investors can accumulate value stocks on dips,\u201d he advised.\n\nPTCL remained the volume leader with 45.978 million shares which closed higher by 45 paisas to Rs14.02 per share. K-Electric Ltd. followed it with 41.567 million shares, which closed lower by 20 paisas to Rs5.59 per share.\n\nOther significant turnover stocks included Treet Corp, PIAC (A), Fauji Fer Bin, Pak Petroleum, WorldCall Telecom, PSO, Pak Int. Bulk and Fauji Foods Ltd. A total of 314 companies recorded future shares, of which 71 increased, 240 decreased and 3 remained unchanged.",

This is in addition to the interim dividend already paid at Rs22 per share i.e. 220%.\n\n\u201cThis outstanding performance was primarily fueled by higher net interest income and provisioning reversals,\u201d said Arif Habib Limited (AHL) in a note.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, UBL\u2019s unprecedented dividend payout in 9MCY23 solidified its position as the leader in dividend payments within the banking sector,\u201d it added.\n\nThe net mark-up/return jumped from Rs28.92 billion in 3QCY22 to Rs39.56 billion in 3QCY23, a significant increase of nearly 37%.\n\nThe fee and commission income earned by the bank in 3QCY23 amounted to Rs4.89 billion, an increase of 14% against Rs4.29 billion earned in the same period last year.\n\nHowever, the foreign exchange income of the firm showed a decline of over 31% down from Rs3.03 billion in 3QCY22 to Rs2.31 billion in 3QCY23.\n\nMeanwhile, the bank sustained massive net losses on securities to the tune of Rs7.84 billion in 3QCY23, in comparison to a gain of Rs109.48 million in SPLY.\n\nUBL\u2019s dividend income remained largely stable, with a 1% increase YoY.\n\nDuring 3QCY23, operating expenses of the firm amounted to Rs18.58 billion, up 29% against Rs14.44 billion in SPLY.\n\nThe firm reported a sharp hike in expenditure on worker welfare funds which increased by over 52% during the period.

            "text": "A broker looks at an index board showing the latest share prices at the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachi. \u2014 AFP/File\n\nStocks closed higher on Tuesday as investors rallied behind the oil and banking sectors on strong valuations, dealers said.\n\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) benchmark KSE 100-share Index gained 380.63 points, or 0.58 percent, to close at 65,906.28 points. The highest index of the day remained at 65,989.54 points, while the lowest level was recorded at 65,492.71 points. The KSE-30 index increased by 128.84 points, or 0.60 percent, to 21,707.85 points.\n\n\"Stocks closed higher, led by oil and banking scrips on strong valuations,\" said analyst Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Corp. \"Surging global stocks, rupee stability amid foreign inflows, and higher global crude oil prices played a catalytic role in the bullish close at the PSX.\"\n\nTraded shares increased by 42 million shares to 303.710 million shares from 261.194 million shares. The trading value rose to Rs12.078 billion from Rs8.945 billion. Market capitalization expanded to Rs9.265 trillion from Rs9.211 trillion. Of the 336 companies active in the session, 173 closed in the green, 144 in the red, and 19 remained unchanged.\n\nAnalyst Naveed Nadeem at Topline Securities said the stock market concluded with the index reaching 65,906, marking a 0.58 percent increase, or 381 points. \"Throughout the day, the index exhibited a mixed performance, experiencing intraday highs and lows at 65,990 and 65,493 points, respectively.\"\n\nContributing positively to the index were the fertilizer, banking, and cement sectors, with FFC, MEBL, UBL, LUCK, and ENGRO collectively adding 305 points. Conversely, EFERT, BAFL, and MCB incurred losses totaling 51 points.\n\nThe highest increase was recorded in Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited shares, which rose by Rs89.89 to Rs8,290 per share, followed by Sapphire Fibres Limited, which increased by Rs87.50 to Rs1,582.50 per share. A significant decline was noted in Bata Pakistan Limited, which fell by Rs37.17 to Rs1,680 per share, followed by Philip Morris (Pakistan) Limited, which closed lower by Rs25 to Rs710 per share.\n\nBrokerage Arif Habib Ltd stated that the benchmark index is once again approaching the 66,000 points mark, having been tested in six trading sessions since the beginning of the month. \"Despite several attempts, the index has yet to breach this significant level.\"\n\nMarket sentiment continues to lean towards an eventual breakthrough, with expectations for the index to surpass its previous highs. Current price action suggests a favorable outlook for the index to breach the 66k mark this week, potentially leading to accelerated gains.\n\nFurthermore, PIAA witnessed a notable surge of 7.5 percent following board approval for the restructuring and privatization of the airline, indicating positive investor sentiment toward the development.\n\nOn another front, the FTSE is set to release its fixed income and equity country classification review of markets on Wednesday, March 27, after the close of the US market. Pakistan is on the watchlist for potential demotion, transitioning from Secondary Emerging to Frontier market status.\n\nAccording to FTSE, Pakistan will be evaluated against the minimum investable market capitalization exit level threshold, set at USD 3.5 billion, based on data as of the close on Friday, December 29, 2023. As of the closing of CY23, Pakistan met this threshold, signaling a crucial factor in the upcoming assessment.\n\nPIAC (A) remained the volume leader with 30.297 million shares, which closed higher by Rs1.77 to Rs25.39 per share. PTCL followed it with 28.146 million shares, which closed higher by 40 paisas to Rs16.10 per share.\n\nOther significant turnover stocks included National Bank XD, Oil & Gas Dev., WorldCall Telecom, Pak Reinsurance, Hascol Petrol, Agritech Limited, The Organic Meat, and Cnergyico PK. In the Future Market, 319 companies recorded trading, of which 153 increased, 157 decreased, and 9 remained unchanged.",
