            "text": "KARACHI: Share prices of Islamic banks took a beating on Monday, thanks to Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar\u2019s recent statement that customers are getting short-changed by Sharia-compliant lenders by way of insufficient returns on deposits.\n\nSpeaking to a TV host, Dr Akhtar said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) should review the issue of minimum deposit rate (MDR) \u2014 a provision that Islamic banks are currently exempted from.\n\nWith every new finance minister in Islamabad comes a fresh wave of measures aimed at shifting money from the bottom lines of banks to the national exchequer. But for the first time in many years, there\u2019s a proposal on the cards that, if adopted, will transfer money from (Islamic) banks to customers.\n\nBack in 2008 when the current finance minister held the position of SBP governor, the regulator directed banks, including Islamic ones, to pay minimum profit rates on savings accounts. Even though Islamic banks were exempted from the provision in subsequent years, conventional banks are still required to pay a certain rate on all savings accounts.\n\nThe MDR is 150 basis points less than the prevailing benchmark interest rate. In other words, every conventional bank is bound to pay an interest rate of 20.5 per cent to its savings account holders as long as the key interest rate remains 22pc.\n\nAccording to Arif Habib Ltd analyst Sana Tawfik, Islamic banks have been exempted from this requirement to promote Sharia-compliant banking in the country.\n\nAmong the three full-fledged Islamic banks listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), the proportion of savings deposits in their total deposits stood at 40pc for Meezan Bank Ltd, 42pc for Faysal Bank Ltd and 25pc for BankIslami Pakistan Ltd at the end of the September quarter, according to Ms Tawfik.\n\nA sensitivity analysis conducted by her brokerage showed that a 1pc increase in the cost of savings deposits will reduce the earnings per share of Meezan Bank Ltd by Rs2.27, Faysal Bank Ltd by Rs1.35 and BankIslami Pakistan Ltd by Rs0.53.\n\nA research report written by JS Global Head of Research Amreen Soorani stated that Islamic banks are currently offering savings rates that are between seven and 9.5 percentage points lower than the MDR offered by conventional banks.\n\n\u201cThe recent sharp rise in interest rates has widened the said spread, which used to range between 300-500 basis points previously,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, a lender like Meezan Bank Ltd with an outsize market share within the Islamic banking industry is expected to successfully counter the negative impact of the MDR for a host of reasons, she said.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019ll be able to mobilise higher deposits by offering the same returns that are being offered by its conventional peers. \u201cThis would likely boost the volumetric growth of the bank\u2019s deposit base,\u201d she said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 28th, 2023",

            "text": "In a positive development, Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Inc., in its results of the February 2024 index review, announced the addition of 22 Pakistani companies as constituents on its Frontier Market (FM) Index and FM Small Cap Indexes.\n\nThe changes will take place as of close on February 29, 2024, it said.\n\nMSCI added three Pakistani companies on its Frontier Market Index. The list features Bank Al Habib Limited, Interloop Limited, and Sui North Gas Pipelines Limited (SNGPL).\n\nIn the MSCI FM Small Cap indexes, 19 Pakistani companies have been added, stated MSCI in the note.\n\nThis includes, Adamjee Insurance Company, Agritech Limited, Aisha Steel Mills, Askari Bank Limited, Century Paper & Board, Ferozesons Laboratories, Ghandhara Industries, Ghani Glass Limited, Hascol Petroleum Limited, IGI Holdings, JS Bank Limited, Murree Brewery, Nishat Chunian, Pakistan Cables, Pakistan Stock Exchange, Service Global Footwear, Sui Southern Gas Company, Treet Corp and Worldcall Telecom.\n\nMeanwhile, four Pakistani companies have been deleted from the MSCI FM Small Cap indexes.\n\nThis includes, BankIslami Pakistan Limited, Fauji Cement Company Limited, Pak Suzuki Motor Co, and Sui North Gas Pipelines.\n\nIt is pertinent to share that the total number of constituents in the MSCI Pakistan Frontier Market Small Cap index is 56.\n\n\u201cAfter this review, Pakistan\u2019s weight in the Index is expected to be around 3%,\u201dsaid Topline Securities in a report. \u201cDue to this adjustment, we anticipate some net flows, although the quantum will not be significant,\u201d it added.\n\nIn September 2021, Pakistan was downgraded from its status as an emerging market, a little over four years after it was reclassified from the Frontier Markets (FM) Index by MSCI.\n\nThe MSCI had said then that while the Pakistani equity market meets the requirements for market accessibility under the classification framework for Emerging Markets, it no longer meets the standards for size and liquidity.",

            "text": "Digital monitor showing the share prices at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) in Karachi. \u2014 INP/File\n\nKARACHI: The first auction of a one-year listed domestic sukuk, held at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday, drew a strong demand from investors, as it was oversubscribed by 13 times, receiving bids more than Rs400 billion, bankers said.\n\nThe government intended to raise Rs30 billion through this auction, but a banker said bids totaling Rs396 billion were received; hence, the auction was about 13 times oversubscribed considering the value of the sukuk\u2019s asset.\n\nThe bankers anticipate that this paper will yield between 19 and 20 percent, even though the finance ministry has not yet revealed the specifics about the funds raised via the sale of sukuk and the cut-off yields the government intended to pay the investors on these investments.\n\n\u201cAs expected, extraordinary response to the first one-year sovereign Islamic paper bidding at the local exchange,\u201d said Mohammed Sohail, the CEO at Topline Securities.\n\n\u201cTotal participation of Rs479 billion compared to the target of Rs30 billion. Soon, the government will decide the amount to raise and cut off yield,\u201d Sohail added.\n\nThe sovereign sukuk is backed by Islamabad Metro (Islamabad Portion) and uses the Ijarah structure, a sharia-compliant sale and lease-back of underlying assets. The joint financial and Shariah advisors for the issuance are Meezan Bank Limited, Dubai Islamic Bank (Pakistan) Limited, BankIslami Pakistan Limited, and Bank Alfalah Limited.\n\nThe government plans to raise a total of Rs90 billion through three government Ijarah sukuk auctions between December 2023 and February 2024.\n\nOn Friday morning, caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar ul Haq Kakar launched the sukuk at the PSX.\n\nAddressing the ceremony marking the first auction of the government Ijarah Sukuks issued on the local bourse, he said it was the collective responsibility of the stock brokers, SECP, and other participants to promote the upcoming primary market auctions to a diverse group of investors, as it is a remarkable achievement for the entire market ecosystem.\n\nAccording to a statement issued by the PSX, the primary market auction of Government Debt Securities (GDS) will now also be held at the PSX.\n\nThis follows the change in rules by the cabinet to enable government debt to be raised from the capital markets, in addition to the State Bank of Pakistan.\n\nFor the first time, one year GoP Ijarah Sukuk will be launched from the Stock Exchange platform in the first phase. In this context, the PSX has notified, in coordination with the Debt Management Office of the Ministry of Finance, a quarterly auction calendar whereby the first primary market auction will be held via the Capital Market Infrastructure Institutions (CMIIs) on December 8, 2023.\n\nCaretaker Federal Minister for Finance, Revenue, and Economic Affairs Dr. Shamshad Akhtar welcomed the prime minister and said, \u201cIt is a momentous occasion for the financial markets and the economy of Pakistan where the government machinery, particularly the Debt Management Office at the Ministry of Finance, has taken the necessary steps enabling primary market auction of Government Debt Securities at the PSX.\n\n\u201cThis step is expected to enhance and augment the efficiency, flexibility, registering, trading, and transferring of the GDS. We are proud of this achievement as this will revolutionise the way primary market auctions will henceforth be held through the capital market ecosystem. The Ijarah Sukuk is a monumental and innovative product. It is the first time that a breakthrough has been achieved whereby the Ijarah Sukuk auction will be held through the capital market ecosystem from today onwards. My compliments to the SECP chairman and the CEO PSX, their teams, as well as my colleagues in Islamabad, particularly the Debt Management Office, who worked tirelessly for this remarkable achievement\u201d.\n\nChairman SECP Akif Saeed stated that government securities were an important tool for the development of the capital market and that the launch of GDS at PSX was just the beginning.\n\nHe urged the PSX, brokers, insurance companies, and asset managers to concentrate their efforts on marketing to attract new investors to the capital market.\n\nWelcoming the guests at the gong ceremony, MD and CEO of PSX Farrukh H. Khan stated, \u201cIt is a very exciting moment for the Exchange whereby the primary market auction of GDS will now take place through the Exchange platform as well. The amendment to the existing Government of Pakistan Market Treasury Bills 1998 and Government of Pakistan Ijarah Sukuk Rules 2008 made this possible which means PSX, in addition to the State Bank, will also be responsible for the primary market auction of GDS. We welcome the fact that the Pakistan Stock Exchange\u2019s platform will be utilised for the primary market auction of the first phase of the one-year GoP Ijarah Sukuk by leveraging the capital market ecosystem comprising of state of the art auction system of PSX, settlement system of NCCPL and the custodial services of CDC. This will generate interest from a wider investor base, enhance transparency, result in competitive pricing of the GDS, and lower the cost of debt for the government.\u201d\n\nPakistan opened up the Islamic bond market to retail investors with first listed sukuk. This will also help diversify government funding sources, boost Islamic finance, and develop a Sharia-compliant capital market.\n\nMeanwhile, the stocks reached a record high on Friday, breaking two key resistance levels in one session, as investors cheered the falling oil prices, foreign buying and strong domestic liquidity.\n\nThey said the market witnessed another historic day, as the benchmark index shattered two psychological thresholds, soaring past 65,000 and 66,000 points during intraday trading to close at an unprecedented high.\n\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange\u2019s benchmark KSE-100 index gained 2.33 percent or 1,505 points to close at 66,223.63 points, the highest level ever recorded. It also posted the fifth-largest daily point gain in its history and the largest weekly point gain of 7.34 percent.\n\nThe index gained 4,532.38 points this week, surpassing the previous weekly point gain record achieved in April 2020. The index sustained its winning streak for the tenth consecutive week, the longest since 2021.\n\nThe market\u2019s bullish momentum was evident from the opening bell, with the index swiftly breaching the 65,000-point mark. The rally continued unabated in the second half, propelling the index beyond 66,000 points.\n\nAnalysts said there was a flush of domestic liquidity pouring into the market as investors were rightly focusing on the cheap valuations, a reasonably settled top-down environment, and lots of room for institutional money to rotate into equities.\n\nMohammed Sohail, Chief Executive of Karachi-based brokerage firm Topline Securities, attributed the bull run to declining oil prices and continuous foreign buying.\n\nHe noted that investors had a new-found confidence in the direction of economic policies and were taking advantage of low valuations as the market, even with its gains, was trading at a cheap price-to-earning ratio.\n\nAnalysts also attributed the bullish trend in the market to the latest development on the IMF front after it praised the actions and policies of the Pakistani authorities, attributing them to the overall enhancement of the economic situation.\n\nThe IMF\u2019s executive board is scheduled to meet on January 11, 2024, to consider final approval for disbursement of the next $700 million tranche from its current loan program.\n\n\u201cStocks closed new record surge and new all-time high amid rupee stability and government\u2019s plan to launch of Rs90 billion auctions on Islamic Ijarah Sukuks to retail investors to diversify funding,\u201d said Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Corp.\n\nHe said that the falling external debt, positive outcome of SIFC initiatives and expectations for a current account surplus in November 2023 played a catalytic role in the new record close at PSX.\n\nThe index remained positive throughout the day, showing an intraday high of 66,273.73 (+1,555.65) and a low of 65,055.17 (+337.10) points. The total volume of the KSE-100 index surged to another record high of 818.337 million shares.\n\nOf the 100 index companies, 66 closed up, 24 closed down, one was unchanged, while nine remained untraded.\n\nThe index was supported by commercial banks with 695.74 points, fertilizer with 183.92 points, oil & gas exploration companies with 181.05 points, oil & gas marketing companies with 97.48 points, and power generation & distribution with 92.57 points.\n\nThe index was let down by automobile assembler with 11.38 points, refinery with 2.01 points, glass & ceramics with 1.09 points, vanaspati & allied industries with 0.54 points, and woollen with 0.1 points.\n\nCompanies adding points to the index were MCB with 166.44 points, HBL with 150.02 points, BAHL with 105.17 points, UBL with 101.44 points, and EFERT with 88.76 points. Companies that dragged the index lower were SYS with 22.13 points, MTL with 14.06 points, LUCK with 10.66 points, BWCL with 6.28 points and UPFL with 5.59 points.",

            "text": "The banking sector in Pakistan maintained robust growth in profitability during 2023, including growth in assets and deposits, the high-interest rate regime allowed them to make handsome margins, increase investment in securities, and lend cash to the federal government at exorbitant financing rates.\n\nOn the other hand, they attracted deposits from customers, providing them with handsome returns too. There have also been major transformations and developments in a few commercial banks, which will impact the banking sector positively in the long term.\n\nALSO READ Bank Alfalah Launches Pakistan\u2019s First Digital Payments Sales and Service Centers Focusing on Merchants and Small Businesses\n\nSome of the initiatives taken by different commercial banks will be followed by other competing banks in the near future. Below are a few major developments that happened during 2023:\n\n(1) Faysal Bank\u2019s Conversion to Islamic Bank\n\nFaysal Bank announced its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank on the first day of the calendar year. The bank converted its assets, deposits, operations, branches, and licenses from conventional to Sharia-based banks and became the second-biggest Islamic bank in the banking industry.\n\nThis transition is said to be the biggest conversion of any conventional bank, not only in Pakistan but in the world, considering the size of the operation. The transformation of Faysal Bank also provided a roadmap for other banks seeking to convert their operations from conventional to Islamic.\n\n(2) MCB Bank Acquires 81% Stake in Asset Management Company\n\nMCB Bank acquired an additional 30 percent stake in its subsidiary, MCBAH Savings and Investments, at the cost of Rs. 649 million. Through this deal, the bank received 21.6 million shares, or 30 percent, of another sponsor, Arif Habib Corporation, at a share price of Rs. 30. Hence, its overall shareholding in the subsidiary increased to over 81 percent from 51 percent.\n\nMCB-AH Limited is one of the leading asset management companies in the fund management sector, and a few companies within a sector are also listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The transition in shareholding will strengthen the position of the bank in the financial sector.\n\n(3) JS Bank Acquires Major Shareholding in BankIslami\n\nJS Bank Acquired major shares in BankIslami to convert the Islamic bank into its subsidiary with ownership of the significant shareholding. The bank increased its stakes in the Islamic bank by 75 percent by purchasing shares from the parent financial entity, JS Group.\n\nThe share swap deal was successful between the sponsors of the Islamic bank, despite being challenged in the Sindh High Court. JS Bank maintained a different strategic position, which will increase its profitability and influence in the banking industry after this deal.\n\n(4) Prominent Banks Plan for Conversion to Islamic Banking\n\nProminent conventional banks with a separate division of Islamic banking announced their plans for full-fledged conversion to Islamic Banking in light of a verdict issued by the Federal Shariat Court last year.\n\nThe banks included the Bank of Punjab, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, and Summit Bank. In this regard, the Bank of Punjab hired a consultant, and Summit Bank rebranded itself as Mukramah Bank. This transition in banking operations will likely attract different conventional banks to follow the same suit.\n\nALSO READ Financial Irregularities Worth Rs.14 Billion Allegedly Uncovered During PSL Audit\n\n(5) Bank Alfalah Acquires Stakes in QistBazaar\n\nBank Alfalah acquired 7.2 percent stakes in BNPL QistBazaar at a cost of Rs. 140 million. The deal can be a win-win situation for both entities in scaling up their business and profitability.\n\nIn addition to the equity agreement, Bank Alfalah, and QistBazaar signed an embedded financing agreement in Shariah-compliant mode for up to Rs. 350 million. Accordingly, the bank will incorporate digital financing products within the QistBazaar platform to offer embedded consumer durables financing in BNPL\u2019s mode.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s move to invest in QistBazaar can prove a stepping stone to strengthening the fintech landscape of the country, as more banks are likely to follow suit for collaboration and investment in fintech companies, which is the need of the hour.\n\n(6) Major Banks to Set up Exchange Companies\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) plans to streamline the business of foreign exchange across the country with control and regulation on trade and flows of foreign currencies, mainly to monitor the stability of the rupee against the dollar. In this regard, the banking industry watched as various exchange companies in Category B shut down while commercial banks were allowed to establish their foreign exchange subsidiaries as an alternate option in the financial sector.\n\nAn overwhelming number of banks made announcements to set up subsidiaries of foreign exchange, including HBL, UBL, MCB, Bank Al Habib, Meezan Bank, Habib Metro Bank, Askari Bank, etc.\n\n(7) Summit Bank Receives Investment from UAE\n\nSummit Bank received a significant capital injection of Rs. 10 billion from its sponsor and prominent UAE investor, Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah.\n\nThe investor subscribed to 3.98 billion new shares of the bank at Rs. 2.51 per share, becoming the major shareholder in the bank. Moreover, Summit Bank plans to convert its entire operation from a conventional banking system to an Islamic one, similar to Faysal Bank. Its board of directors also approved a three-year conversion plan, and the bank has been renamed Bank Makramah Limited\n\n(8) Silk Bank Attracts Investors\n\nSilk Bank, once again, sought the financial support of a strong investor on a long-term basis to fulfill its regulatory requirements of paid-up capital and the sustainability of its profitable operations.\n\nThe bank has attracted interest from MCB Bank, United Bank Limited, International Commercial Bank of South Sudan, and Pakistan Housing Finance Company for investment and merger. At present, these financial institutions are carrying out the due diligence of the bank, which is showing the increasing competition among these entities in striking a deal with Silk Bank.\n\nSudanese Bank and Pakistan Housing Company even expressed their investment plans of 50 million euros and Rs. 12 billion, respectively. With four proposals in hand, it is a good time for Silk Bank to say yes to at least one institution with remarkable experience in local industry and operating a subsidiary.\n\nALSO READ State Bank Fails to Satisfy Panel in Rs. 70 Billion Money Laundering Scandal\n\n(9) Meezan Bank Collaborates to Launch Islamic Microfinance Services\n\nMeezan Bank took the initiative to collaborate with SAFCO Microfinance Company Private Limited (SMCL) for the launch of Islamic microfinance services in the low-income segment of society.\n\nThis is the first time that a commercial bank has significantly supported a microfinance institution. The leading Islamic bank has committed to providing Rs. 100 million in financing and technical support for product development, capacity building, and training for the microfinance company.\n\nThe step will further accelerate the penetration of Islamic banking across the country. The microfinance company established its inaugural Islamic microfinance branch under the brand name \u2018Yaqeen\u2019 in Hyderabad, Pakistan.\n\n(10) HBL to Set Up a Specialized Agri Subsidiary\n\nHabib Bank Limited received approval from the State Bank of Pakistan to set up a specialized subsidiary for the agriculture sector. The subsidiary will work to provide financial access to farmers and other players in the agriculture sector, particularly, but the institution has plans to be deeply involved in the sector\u2019s development.\n\nThe leading bank previously carried out different projects successfully in this sector, which gave it the confidence to enhance its footprints in the food sector with a much bigger role and a long-term profitable engagement. The out-of-box approach of the bank\u2019s leadership might give it a competitive edge in the industry.",
