            "text": "ISLAMABAD: The Competition Commission of Pakistan (CCP) has approved the entry of a financial institution into the consumer market of \u201cBuy Now Pay Later Service.\u201d\n\nThe CCP received an application for acquisition from QistBazaar (Private) Limited for the subscription of 7.2% of its shareholding by Bank Alfalah Limited.\n\nThe CCP received a pre-merger application from M/s. QistBazaar (Private) Limited. The application was made pursuant to Section 11 of the Competition Act, 2010 read in conjunction with Regulation 6 of the Competition (Merger Control) Regulations, 2016.\n\nBank Alfalah enters VC ecosystem, takes 7.2% equity stake in QistBazaar\n\nThe proposed transaction entailed subscription of shareholding of the Target by M/s. Bank Alfalah Limited as per \u201cAdvance Against Share Agreement.\u201d All requisite information/documentation pertaining to the Application was completed on 4th October 2023.\n\nThe CCP examined the application as well as all the documents attached therewith and the information provided by the concerned undertaking(s).\n\nThe Phase-I competition assessment of this transaction revealed that the proposed acquisition would not lead to the dominance of the acquirer in the relevant market post-transaction. Therefore, the CCP granted its authorization under Section 11 of the Competition Act, 2010, and CCP\u2019s Merger Regulations, 2016.\n\nQistBazaar sells white goods, electronics and home goods online on the \u201cbuy now pay later\u201d model. In the current inflationary situation in the economy, it is a major facility for those who are struggling financially. The purchase of shares by Bank Alfalah will provide the necessary financing for QistBazaar to provide better service and improve its infrastructure.\n\nAccording to CCP, it will also open up a new online market for consumers enhancing competition with retailers across the region. This will improve services to the consumers. \u201cCCP is very keen to remove all obstacles and impediments in every sector of the economy to enhance competition,\u201d read a statement issued by the CCP.\n\nThe merger order said that ancillary restrictions have been reported in this transaction, which may require exemption under Section 5 of the Act, read with Regulation 4 of the Competition Commission (Exemption) Regulations 2020. This Order is without prejudice to any such requirements.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2023",

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "short_description": "What\u2019s up at the stock market? A rebuttal  Profit by Pakistan Today",
            "text": "On 14th December, a leading English newspaper published an opinion piece by the title \u201cWhat\u2019s up at the stock market?\u201d The fact that the write-up showed little understanding of the stock market needs no mention. But it becomes alarming when an attempt is made to understand a larger-than-life scenario in a few words. It would be like trying to write a page length summary of War and Peace expecting to get all the nuance and significance of the literary masterpiece.\n\nWhat is in the op-ed?\n\nLet\u2019s start off by trying to understand what the writer has tried to say. The writer admits outright that he rarely writes about the stock market and that he has a pessimistic view even when he does write. This already sets the expectation that he is not going to laud the market for its recent rally.\n\nThe skepticism shown here is warranted to an extent. Too many times in the past, the rally and gains in the stock market have been artificial in nature and have left retail investors holding the short end of the stick. This publication recently did a series on the three stock market crashes seen in a span of nine years at the Karachi Stock Exchange.\n\nSo it is no surprise that the op-ed\u2019s central theme is that the current rise needs to be seen with some suspicion. The rise is seen as being made up of 22,500 points which have primarily been made up of two sectors: banking and energy, where energy includes the fertiliser sector. Banks and energy have a high weightage in the KSE 100 index, and as these companies will see an increase, so will the index.\n\nIs the increase justified by the rise in earnings of these two sectors? The writer highlights the fact that out of Rs 417 billion of profits after tax seen for the first quarter, more than a third are from banks totalling Rs 149 billion, while Rs 30 billion are from oil marketing companies alone. Even based on their past results, this is a huge increase for both sectors. Banks have earned due to high interest rates, while oil marketing companies have profited from the depreciating currency and inventory gains.\n\nThe op-ed also mentions this idea of the \u2018bad broker\u2019, who is seen as being an agent of only a few clients and high net worth individuals. He is responsible for pumping the market in the direction which one or two clients want, while the broker is able to disadvantage all his remaining clientele to benefit a few. There is little economic relevance to the market turning the corner \u2013 instead, it is funded by a few brokers and their clients.\n\nWhat is not in the op-ed?\n\nThe writer leaves out some key insights from his piece which need to be mentioned.\n\nFirst, let us address the earnings question. As mentioned earlier, banks have earned due to high interest rates, while oil marketing companies have profited from the depreciating currency and inventory gains. The writer is correct in regards to the main factor behind the earnings of these two sectors \u2013 but there is a need to widen the scope of the study. The market has still seen a further rise in profits, and the writer fails to take into account the other Rs 238 billion that have been earned in after tax profits. These make up more than 57% of the remaining profits.\n\nSecondly, and more importantly, let us examine the short-term view. It is true that the market has increased from 40,000 points on June 23, 2023 to 66,500 on December 12, 2023, which is an increase of 66.3%. Out of this total increase, 45% is contributed by the banking and energy sector including the fertilizer sector. The remaining 21% has come from the remaining index constituents. Is the writer correct?\n\nNot quite. The KSE 100 index is weighted in such a manner which means that 60% of the weightage is given to the banking and energy sector while the remaining is made up by the rest of the index. This would mean that when index increases by 100 points, 60 points are expected to come from these two sectors while the remaining will come from the other companies. When things are put in that context, it can be expected that the whole index has gained and rather than just a few sectors, the whole index has seen an increase.\n\nWhat is the analysis company wise? Considering the increase seen in individual shares, 18 companies have seen an increase of more than 70% which are part of the banking and energy sector in the period analysed. An additional piece of information that is needed here is the fact that there are also 16 other index constituents which have seen an increase of more than 70% which are not part of these sectors.\n\nCompany Sector Weightage Return K-Electric Limited Energy 0.70% 176.83% Service Industries Limited Leather & Tanneries 0.65% 166.30% Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited Fertilizer 0.64% 155.70% National Refinery Limited Energy 0.41% 150.63% Pak Elektron Limited Cable & Electric 0.50% 148.46% Interloop Limited Textile 0.90% 116.68% Bank AL Habib Limited Bank 2.68% 112.70% Attock Refinery Limited Energy 0.66% 108.41% Pakistan State Oil Company Limited Energy 1.98% 107.88% Askari Bank Limited Bank 0.49% 106.27% Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited Bank 1.19% 106.25% International Steels Limited Steel 0.54% 105.62% International Industries Limited Engineering 0.43% 105.57% Thal Limited Auto 0.52% 105.26% Meezan Bank Limited Bank 3.32% 104.55% Pakistan Petroleum Limited Energy 3.79% 104.04% Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited Paper & Board 0.68% 94.51% National Bank of Pakistan Bank 0.83% 93.89% Unity Foods Limited Food & Personal Care 0.49% 91.31% Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd IT 0.41% 90.81% The Bank of Punjab Bank 0.50% 89.66% The Hub Power Company Limited Energy 5.42% 87.89% Pak-Gulf Leasing Company Limited Financial Services 0.00% 83.45% Habib Bank Limited Bank 3.38% 81.49% Cnergyico PK Limited Energy 0.46% 79.57% Bank Alfalah Limited Bank 1.67% 79.34% Kohinoor Textile Mills Limited Textile 0.23% 79.13% Yousaf Weaving Mills Limited Textile 0.01% 76.32% Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited Energy 1.02% 74.15% Pakistan International Bulk Terminal Transport 0.30% 73.57% Standard Chartered Bank (Pak) Ltd Bank 0.32% 73.10% Frieslandcampina Engro Pakistan Limited Food & Personal Care 0.33% 72.58% Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited Financial Services 0.27% 71.14% Fauji Cement Company Limited Cement 0.80% 71.08%\n\nSimilarly, once accounting for weightages, 23 companies from the banking and energy sector contributed more than 0.5% each and 13 other companies also increased by more than 0.5% each. In short, it can be seen that it is not only these two sectors which have contributed to the gain but other sectors have also contributed to the increase.\n\nCompany Sector Weightage Return Weighted Return The Hub Power Company Limited Energy 5.42% 87.89% 4.76% Pakistan Petroleum Limited Energy 3.79% 104.04% 3.94% Meezan Bank Limited Bank 3.32% 104.55% 3.47% Bank AL Habib Limited Bank 2.68% 112.70% 3.02% Habib Bank Limited Bank 3.38% 81.49% 2.75% United Bank Limited Bank 3.99% 68.02% 2.71% Oil & Gas Development Company Limited Energy 3.72% 68.20% 2.54% MCB Bank Limited Bank 3.56% 68.74% 2.45% Pakistan State Oil Company Limited Energy 1.98% 107.88% 2.14% Lucky Cement Limited Cement 3.46% 57.58% 1.99% Millat Tractors Limited Auto 2.55% 64.47% 1.64% Engro Fertilizers Limited Fertilizer 3.11% 43.33% 1.35% Bank Alfalah Limited Bank 1.67% 79.34% 1.32% Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited Bank 1.19% 106.25% 1.26% K-Electric Limited Energy 0.70% 176.83% 1.24% Mari Petroleum Company Limited Energy 2.61% 44.34% 1.16% Engro Corporation Limited Fertilizer 3.98% 27.37% 1.09% Service Industries Limited Leather & Tanneries 0.65% 166.30% 1.08% Interloop Limited Textile 0.90% 116.68% 1.05% Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited Fertilizer 0.64% 155.70% 1.00% Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited Fertilizer 3.83% 23.83% 0.91% Colgate-Palmolive (Pakistan) Limited FMCG 1.82% 49.68% 0.90% National Bank of Pakistan Bank 0.83% 93.89% 0.78% Dawood Hercules Corporation Limited Fertilizer 2.01% 38.16% 0.77% Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited Energy 1.02% 74.15% 0.76% Pak Elektron Limited Cable & Electric 0.50% 148.46% 0.74% Attock Refinery Limited Energy 0.66% 108.41% 0.72% Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited Paper & Board 0.68% 94.51% 0.64% National Refinery Limited Energy 0.41% 150.63% 0.62% Systems Limited IT 3.60% 16.35% 0.59% International Steels Limited Steel 0.54% 105.62% 0.57% Fauji Cement Company Limited Cement 0.80% 71.08% 0.57% D.G.

From the period of June till December, there were 48 companies which saw a return of more than 100%. Banking and energy only made up 10 of these companies while the remaining were companies that trade on the stock market but are not part of the KSE 100 index..\n\nThe writer posits that most of the index has seen a rise which is based on just two sectors. But in fact the stock market has actually seen a much wider sale increase in both index related and shares not part of the index.\n\nThis can lead to additional worries of bubbles being created, and that can be addressed with mechanisms developed by the stock exchange. However, this does not mean that the index has only increased due to movement in these two sectors.\n\nThe evil stockbroker\n\nThe second part of the op-ed deals with the notion that the evil stock brokers are able to dictate the movement of shares. These are stock brokers who are able to game the system for some of their clients, and benefit a few among them.\n\nI strongly disagree with this notion. The fact of the matter is that no broker in the market is so large that he can cause and sustain a rally of this magnitude for this long. As already shown, the movement is taking place all across the board and no broker has the resources to be able to lead to such a sustained rally by themself. Even if they are able to join forces, they still do not have the capital to be able to lead to a rally like the one seen recently.\n\nEven if it is agreed upon that clients are being disadvantaged by selling snake oil to smaller investors, how is this model sustainable? Once this rally is over, and one is able to dupe retail investors in losing their money, how will the broker sustain himself in the future?\n\nHere, let us recap what the market is and who its participants are. On the face of it, the market is made up of buyers and sellers. In order to buy from the market, there has to be someone who is willing to sell their shares.\n\nBut it is important to understand who is buying and who is selling. Pakistan is able to get investments from outside its own borders where foreigners can trade in the stock market. This is known as Foreign Investors Portfolio Investments (FIPI). Similarly, when local investors invest in the market, these are known as Local Investors Portfolio Investment (LIPI). Both these categories are made up of individuals and corporations who invest and divest their shares in the market. In terms of LIPI, trade data is also broken down for individuals, companies, banks, non-banking financial companies, mutual funds, brokers themselves, insurance companies and other organizations that might wish to invest in the stock market.\n\nThe trade data for FIPI from June 23, 2023 to December 15, 2023 shows that foreigners were net buyers of $72 million. This means that foreign investors, who have their own research to back their decision making of investment, invested in the market. Brokers can have the best manipulative powers in the world but to make a foreign investor fall for your trap would seem highly unlikely. Foreign investors have a long term view towards investment and have to justify their investment rather than say \u2018the broker asked me to invest\u2019.\n\nIn terms of LIPI, most of the buying was carried out by companies and insurance companies, while individuals and brokers sold their shares. Again, seeing only the sale would point towards shares being offloaded but the shares were bought by companies and insurance companies who have investment committee and advisory bodies who dictate how investment has to be carried out. The investment committees have to rationalize every investment decision before they follow through on it.\n\nThe need for a better understanding\n\nIt might seem like a good idea to have someone to blame and someone to target when a rally is going on in the market. After all, if an asset bubble is being created, the best course of action would be to point it out to investors beforehand.\n\nThe problem begins when an incomplete picture is used to make a judgment. Just like the tail of three blind men seeing something different rather than the elephant in the room, there is a need to take all factors into consideration before a judgment is made.\n\nThe real winners, losers and the one left \u2018holding the bag\u2019 will be revealed in due time. Even I don\u2019t feign to know the actual reasons behind this rally and am able to separate the fact from fiction. However, the op-ed feels like a knee jerk reaction on the basis of few facts, and it fails to take into account all factors relevant in this rally. This rebuttal is a small attempt to provide some reason to the recent rise.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Lucky Cement Ltd has completed a second share buyback exercise representing 6.5 per cent of its paid-up capital at spot prices, the company said on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Arif Habib Ltd, the cement maker\u2019s average purchase price was Rs632.60 per share for 20.375 million shares that it bought between June 2 and Nov 20.\n\nAs a result, the share buyback cost the company a total of Rs12.9 billion, which makes it the biggest exercise of its kind conducted on the Pakistan Stock Exchange.\n\nThe company completed its first buyback round consisting of 10m shares back in March at a total cost of Rs4.35bn. The stated purpose of the buyback exercise is to cancel the shares after acquiring them using the company\u2019s distributable profits.\n\nMany listed companies have carried out share repurchase exercises in the ready market in the recent past. The total number of shares goes down once a company conducts a buyback, leading to an increase in its earnings per share as well as its break-up value \u2014 the amount that the company would be worth if it was liquidated.\n\nCompanies that have completed share buybacks in recent months include Netsol Technologies Ltd, JDW Sugar Mills Ltd, Bank Alfalah Ltd, Engro Corporation Ltd, Kohat Cement Company Ltd, Habib Bank Ltd and Kohinoor Textile Mills Ltd.\n\nSome analysts believe the reduction in the volume of tradeable shares is bad for the stock market. Others say the exercise provides investors with a higher-than-usual share price to liquidate their investments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 22nd, 2023",

Its previous all-time high closing was 66,427.78 points on Dec 12. 2023.\n\nThe overall trading volume rose further by 16.75pc to 354.59 million shares. The traded value, however, fell 1.60pc to Rs11.88bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Lotte Chemical (42.83m shares), Telecard Ltd (29.17m shares), Pakistan Tele\u00adcomm\u00adunication Com\u00adpany Ltd (24.70m shares), The Organic Meat Company Ltd (18.79m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (16.03m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan (Rs235.00), Shahmurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs31.38), Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs30.32), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs23.92) and Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs11.64).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs240.00), Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs106.50), Unilever Foods (Rs100.00), Hoechst Pakistan (Rs93.87) and Sapphire Textile (Rs84.05).\n\nForeign investors continued picking shares as their next purchase worth $0.33m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 28th, 2024",

            "text": "Bank Alfalah Limited, one of Pakistan\u2019s leading commercial banks, has announced an investment of Rs 1.2 billion in its brokerage subsidiary, Alfalah CLSA Securities (Private) Limited.\n\nThe brokerage house is a sort of partnership between the Abu Dhabi Group-owned Bank Alfalah and CLSA Limited, which is a brokerage house based in Thailand.\n\nThe company is currently running a pure agency brokerage house offering equity brokerage, online trading, commodities trading, research, investment banking, foreign exchange services, money market, and advisory services.\n\nWhy is there a need for such a large investment?\n\nThe recent accounts of Alfalah CLSA show that the company went from making a profit of Rs. 7 million in 2022 to a loss of Rs. 1.1 billion in 2023. The onus of the poor performance lies on the brokerage house\u2019s inability to control operating expenses. Additionally, the company utilized a short-term borrowing facility to increase its exposure margin, leading to a significant rise in finance costs.\n\nIn order to shore up the brokerage house, the bank has decided to invest a large amount. in fact, due to the loss made this year, Alfalah CLSA saw its equity turn negative. In order to shore up investor confidence and to make sure the brokerage house keeps operating, the bank was strengthening the balance sheet.\n\nThis is not the first time such an investment is being made. The bank originally owned 97.91% of the brokerage house when it was incorporated in 2003. Once the house started to perform, right shares were given out to investors which decreased the bank\u2019s shareholding. Financial years of 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 have not been good for the brokerage house as it has made a cumulative loss of Rs. 1 billion which led to the equity turning negative.\n\nBacked by big players\n\nBank Alfalah is one of the largest banks of Pakistan with a network of over 1000 branches across more than 200 cities and has an international presence in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bahrain and UAE. The bank is originally owned by Abu Dhabi Group and has been operating since 1992. The bank owns 61.2% of Alfalah CLSA Securities (Private) Limited and has 40.2% ownership of Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited which is an asset management company of the bank.\n\nCLSA BV was a company founded in 1986 by Jim Walker and Gary Coull who were journalists by profession and are considered to be pioneers of the Asian securities industry and its development. The company has a network spanning Asia, Australia, Europe and United States and has offices in 21 locations around the world. The company is known for its investment advisory and asset management services and has been awarded for its renowned services. CLSA was overtaken by CITIC Securities in 2013. CLSA owns 24.9% of Alfalah CLSA as of today.\n\nCITIC Securities is China\u2019s leading brokerage and investment bank and largest underwriter of Chinese debt and equity. CITIC was founded in 1995 and offers brokerage services, investment banking and asset management to corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals.\n\nThe new investment in perspective\n\nThe investment of Rs. 1.2 billion would be channeled towards purchasing and subscribing additional shares of the brokerage house at Rs. 10 per share. This investment is going to be for an indefinite period.\n\nThe resolution, as mentioned earlier, has been passed which means that an additional 120 million shares in the brokerage house will be issued and subscribed.\n\nThe brokerage house currently has 40 million issued and subscribed shares and would be increasing them to 160 million with Bank Alfalah\u2019s shareholding increasing from 62.5% to 90.6% and decreasing CLSA BV\u2019s share from 24.9% to 6.2%.",

            "text": "Segregation of client assets is critical as brokers have been penalised for using client money illegally. PHOTO: AFP\n\nA two-day record-breaking rally paused on Friday at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) as it dropped nearly 140 points over profit-taking by investors, an unimpressive economic growth and a hike in power tariffs.\n\nFederal Minister of Finance Muhammad Aurangzeb visited the PSX, where he asserted that Pakistan was expected to reach an agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a three-year Extended Fund Facility by the end of June.\n\nIn the morning, trading began on a positive note where market players anticipated a good outcome of government\u2019s efforts to speed up the privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and other state-owned entities.\n\nHowever, trading remained range bound as the finance minister indicated that next fiscal year\u2019s budget may not be \u201cpro-growth\u201d.\n\nIn addition, the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) raised power tariff and the National Accounts Committee reported just 1% economic growth for 2QFY24, which caused jitters in the market.\n\nThe KSE-100 index touched its intra-day low of 66,822.43 around midday. Later, it recouped some of the losses and closed with a decline of 137 points.\n\n\u201cStocks closed lower amid institutional profit-taking after Pakistan posted a dismal GDP growth of 1% for 2QFY24 and Nepra\u2019s approval for an increase in power tariff under quarterly adjustment,\u201d said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.\n\n\u201cThe finance minister hinted at a reduction in development spending and energy sector reforms ahead of Pakistan-IMF talks on April 14-15. Besides, surging treasury bond yields played the role of catalyst in bearish close of the market,\u201d he added.\n\nAt close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a loss of 137.02 points, or 0.20%, and settled at 67,005.11.\n\nRead PSX hits all-time high, crosses 67,200 points\n\nTopline Securities, in its report, said that a range-bound session was observed at the PSX as the KSE-100 index traded between the intra-day high of 166 points and intra-day low of -320 points. It closed at 67,005, down 0.2%.\n\nMajor positive contribution of 515 points to the index came from Meezan Bank, Engro Corporation, MCB Bank, Pakistan Tobacco and Colgate-Palmolive.\n\nOn the flip side, Fauji Fertiliser, Bank Alfalah, Oil and Gas Development Company, TRG Pakistan and Hub Power pulled the index down by 451 points, Topline added.\n\nArif Habib Limited (AHL), in its review, remarked that stocks reached new highs with gains of 2.8% week-on-week.\n\nOn Friday, Engro Corporation (+1.47%), MCB Bank (+1.61%) and Meezan Bank (+1.15%) were the biggest contributors to the index gains.\n\nTotal participation in Secure Logistics book-building came in at Rs611 million versus offer of Rs600 million at a strike price of Rs12 per share, it said. In addition, Bank Alfalah (-2.86%) was set to start due diligence for acquiring Saudi National Bank\u2019s 100% stake after Samba Bank.\n\nOverall trading volumes decreased to 313.04 million shares against Thursday\u2019s tally of 421.1 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs9.9 billion.\n\nShares of 343 companies were traded. Of these, 136 stocks closed higher, 188 dropped and 19 remained unchanged. Pakistan International Airlines was the volume leader with trading in 39.2 million shares, gaining Rs2.2 to close at Rs31.54. It was followed by PTCL with 32.2 million shares, losing Rs0.15 to close at Rs18.27 and Cnergyico PK with 18.9 million shares, losing Rs0.14 to close at Rs4.42.\n\nForeign investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs64.2 million, according to the NCCPL.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 30th, 2024.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",

            "text": "KARACHI: The stock market maintained its bullish trend on the eve of general elections as investors continued cherry-picking, propelling the benchmark KSE 100-share index above the 64,000 level on Wednesday.\n\nThe index remained in the green from the start of trading extending overnight gains as investors stayed optimistic despite two bomb blasts in Balochistan near electroal candidates offices leaving over two dozen innocent people dead and many critically injured.\n\nHowever, the caretaker provincial administration announced that polls would be held across the province on Thursday.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said Hub Power, Meezan Bank, Engro Fertiliser, United Bank and Bank Alfalah attracted investor interest as a result these scrips collectively contributed 197 points to the index.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said an upbeat economic outlook, strong earnings in the oil and banking sectors and the government\u2019s resolve to reduce energy sector circular debt helped the equity market to stay bullish.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,143.87 points after adding 344.85 points or 0.54 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume fell just 1pc to 327.59 million shares. The traded value also dipped by 5.83pc to Rs14.30bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan K-Electric (44.37m shares), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (24.95m shares), Pak Elektron (21.26m shares) and Pakistan Refinery Ltd (18.71m shares) and Cnergyico PK (17.22m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hoechst Pakistan Ltd (Rs76.34), Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs41.00), Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs21.20), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs18.18) and Service Industries Ltd (Rs15.00).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Premium Textile Mills Ltd (Rs19.00), Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs13.48), JS Global Capital Ltd (Rs10.95), Philip Morris Pakistan Ltd (Rs10.00) and Shield Corporation Ltd (Rs9.90).\n\nForeign investors remained net buyers as they purchased shares worth $1.41m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 8th, 2024",
