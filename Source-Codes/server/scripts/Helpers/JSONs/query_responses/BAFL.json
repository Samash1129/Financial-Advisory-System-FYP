In the current scenario, however, the situation has changed with most fertilizer companies now facing similar gas costs across the board, which is comparatively beneficial for AGL. The stock has rallied almost 60% since March 15, 2024\u201d.\n\nALSO READ Treet Corporation Limited Authorized to Sell 11.3% Stake in Battery Subsidiary\n\nAGL had issued 159 million Preference Shares in 2012 under the Share Subscription Agreement dated 13th February 2012 to selected investors.\n\nThe Company received a notice from Bank Alfalah Limited (PSX: BAFL) on 29th February 2024 for the conversion of its entire (10.8 million) preference shares into ordinary shares under the Share Subscription Agreement dated 13th February 2012. It has now complied with the request.\n\nIt bears mentioning that AGL\u2019s scrip at the bourse is at lower lock after the notice. At the time of filing, the company\u2019s scrip was Rs. 26.21, down 7.48 percent or Rs. 2.12 with a turnover of 1.6 million shares on Tuesday.",

By all indications, this was a company that was healthy and making money. Then came 2022. This was the year when the economy started overheating, inflation was through the roof, political instability was at its peak, a deal with the IMF was falling through, and a new government had come to power in controversial circumstances. Naturally, the stock market dipped. As a result, Alfalah\u2019s brokerage house posted a loss of Rs 1.2 crores. By the standards and circumstances, this was a crisis avoided.\n\nAnd then comes 2023. In June last year, Pakistan successfully concluded talks with the IMF and the stock market surged off the back of the news that default had been averted. Trading floors heated up and daily trade volumes reached as high as 818 million trades. The markets had gained much-awaited momentum, and brokerage houses were set to clean house. Leading brokerage houses like AKD Securities, Arif Habib and Sherman Securities posted profits of Rs 90.3 crores, Rs 97.5 crores and Rs 57.3 crores respectively.\n\nBut somehow Bank Alfalah CLSA failed to cash in on the year that was 2023. Not only did they not post a profit, they ended up making a massive loss of more than Rs 1 billion. A loss so huge that its equity went from being Rs 34.1 crores to negative equity of Rs 78.5 crores. The brokerage house could not sustain the losses and needed additional liquidity to be injected in order to make its equity positive again. In the middle of all this, the company\u2019s CEO Atif Khan also left quietly after a hush-hush resignation.\n\nIn the wake of the massive loss, Bank Alfalah, the parent company of the brokerage house, had to scramble to put out the fire. Bank Alfalah CLSA was well in the red and the bank had to pump in a further Rs 1.2 billion in the company. Before this, Bank Alfalah\u2019s share in the brokerage house was 62.5% and now it has gone up to 90.6%. The injection of capital was a simple instrument to save the brokerage house. But how were the losses posted? Sources have told Profit some of the brokerage\u2019s senior management made some bad calls and then tried to hide some of the bigger losses they made. The possibilities within this are two-fold. The first is that the senior management trusted the wrong clients. The other is that they knowingly shifted things around, and the company is now having to regroup.\n\nTo understand what could have happened at Bank Alfalah CLSA for it to bleed over a billion rupees in a year, it is necessary to understand how brokerage house\u2019s work.\n\nHow it all works\n\nThere are a few ways a brokerage house can make money. The most basic source of revenue is commissions that a brokerage charges on trades and the different services they provide such as consults and underwriting.\n\nThis is why brokerage houses with large clientele like AKD Securities, Arif Habib and JS Global Capital can earn operating revenue of more than Rs 50 crores. But there are additional sources of income to this as well.\n\nA brokerage house is able to buy and sell shares for themselves as well. This is called proprietary trading and allows the brokerage house to keep shares as a part of their own portfolio. This is not the primary function of a house but they can still buy shares with their own funds. Lastly there are \u201cother incomes\u201d, which are incomes derived from sources that are not directly related to the key function of a brokerage house. This includes dividend income on the shares that the house has and markup earned on bank deposits are incomes that the house will not consider as part of its main services and would categorise them as other incomes. When all these incomes are put together, the brokerage house is able to tally up its total income.\n\nFrom these incomes, it subtracts, like any other service business, operational costs like salaries, rent, electricity, etc. These are the expenses that have to be paid and borne in order to operate the brokerage house.\n\nThe reason behind AKD Securities making a profit of Rs 90.3 crores was due to the fact that they made operating revenues of Rs 59.3 crores and a realised gain of Rs 41.1 crores. Similarly, Arif Habib earned operating revenues of Rs 69.7 crores and unrealised gain of Rs 76.3 crores which led to the house making a profit of Rs Rs 97.5 crores.\n\nSigns of distress\n\nThe first indications of distress came from Bank Alfalah itself. On 27th February 2024, the bank announced it was going to hold its Annual General Meeting on the 20th of March 2024. Among the other agenda items, one item was a special resolution where the bank was looking to invest Rs 1.2 billion into Alfalah CLSA in exchange for its shares. This was pretty standard up until now.\n\nIt was the attachments that were given by the bank which were cause for alarm. The bank disclosed to the stock exchange that Alfalah CLSA, in its unaudited accounts, had seen a loss per share of 28.34 for 2023 and the value of its equity had turned negative Rs 19.64 per share.\n\nIn absolute terms, the loss amounted to around Rs 1.1 billion.\n\nBefore the year, the company had an equity of Rs 34.1 crores. After considering the loss, it went down to Rs 78.5 crores in the red. Negative equity means that the company is not viable for operations anymore. Its assets have fallen in value compared to its liabilities. Even if all the assets are liquidated today, the liabilities will not be met. In other terms, as creditors cannot be paid, either the company declares insolvency or sees an injection of new equity.\n\nA loss of Rs 1.1 billion is already too large. But consider the fact that by September end, the company only had losses of Rs 1. crore. This means that an additional loss of Rs 1.09 billion was made in 3 months. The company lost Rs 1.09 billion in 90 days. That is Rs 1.2 crores a day or Rs 5 lakhs per hour. It is difficult to consider a loss of 5 lakhs being made in an hour.\n\nIn the Annual General Meeting held, Bank Alfalah shareholders voted to save the brokerage house and resolved to inject the extra investment into the company. The specific reasons behind the loss will become clearer once the annual accounts are done being audited. As such, little can be said with any concrete evidence.\n\nAs the annual accounts are still under audit, there is little that can be said with any concrete evidence. The company is expected to release its accounts in the first half of April according to regulations and it can be expected that they will come in the week after Eid. When the management at Alfalah CLSA was asked for the accounts, they stated that they will be published once they are finalised.\n\nBut sources close to the company have painted a picture of financial misdemeanour and irregularities on the part of the brokerage house\u2019s top management including its erstwhile CEO.\n\nThey have alleged that senior management was carrying out wrongful practices in order to inflate the value of the stocks and then using that to maintain their books. Once the game of musical chairs stopped, they had no option but to accept the reality of the situation sooner rather than later.\n\nThe alleged reason for the losses\n\nThe goal of the stock market is to allow investors to buy their shares, pay money for the shares they have bought and get to own them. This is the normal course of business and allows for smooth functioning to take place. A common practice that is used in the Pakistani market is that a client will call up a brokerage house and ask them to buy a share for them. In normal circumstances, the client is supposed to put up the money for this purchase.\n\nAs he is a big client, the brokerage house buys the shares on behalf of the client without the client having to put up the money. Once the share price increases, the client sells those shares, squares his position and makes a profit. The brokerage house makes commission and everyone lives happily ever after.\n\nBut what if the shares actually lose value? When the shares lose value, the client is left with keeping the shares until they actually earn a profit. In older days, this would be easy to do. Not in today\u2019s stock exchange where the stock exchange itself and the regulator have a keen eye on what is going on in the market. In order to regulate the brokers, both Pakistan Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan require the brokers to file accounts and returns at quarterly intervals. Any sort of mismanagement would be identified early and brokers can be asked to explain any discrepancies.\n\nUnless they are a step ahead of the game.\n\nIn the case of a company like Alfalah CLSA, a lot of what matters is the personal connection a broker has with his clients. In this case, for example, a client of Alfalah CLSA could call up the brokerage house\u2019s CEO and ask them to buy certain shares for them. If the CEO or any other person managing affairs was partial to it, they might order that the sale go ahead. As such, the brokerage house would buy the shares on their own account on behalf of the client.\n\nThe brokerage house on behalf of this big client would then buy, say, 1,000,000 shares of ABC for Rs. 10. The total value of the trade was going to be Rs 1 crore. Now near the end of the quarter, the share price falls to Rs. 8. Rather than showing a loss of Rs 2 crores in its accounts, the brokerage house could sell the shares to another house or any of its clients for Rs. 11. Once the quarter end date passed, the brokerage house would buy the shares back at Rs. 11 and things would go back to normal.\n\nEssentially by selling their position in the market to someone else and they would evade having to disclose the loss that should have actually been realised.\n\nIn regular circumstances, the loss made would be recorded and a debit balance would be shown in the accounts in order to show that even though the shares have fallen in value, another asset receivable from the client is still there so the loss is not actually made by the brokerage house.\n\nBuying on behalf of a non paying client is a big no-no and having a debit balance in a client\u2019s ledger is carefully scrutinised by PSX and SECP. In order to avoid this, the management would most likely be selling and buying the shares back to avoid this situation from taking place. And while this kept them away from prying eyes for a while, it was a system that would eventually come crashing down.\n\nAs each quarter end would be nearing, this same tactic was allegedly being used to make sure losses and debit balances are not reported in the accounts. This merry go round can keep going for an infinite amount of time. Just like a ponzi scheme can be made to continue for a long period of time, this can be done to build a house of cards. But the problem with that is that it is nonetheless a house of cards. One day it will all come crashing down. Which it did.\n\nAlfalah CLSA had no option but to set their affairs in order, bring a change in leadership, and realise these losses. It was a responsible response to irresponsible behaviour from their management. There are reports that even March 2024 end accounts will show a loss as the real magnitude of these losses have not been fully realised till now.\n\nProfit reached out to Alfalah CLSA but the company did not respond. This correspondent also reached out to the former CEO of the company, Atif Khan, who also did not respond to Profit\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAfter the publication of this story, Bank Alfalah Limited issued a statement saying that it is committed to the long-term success and financial stability of its subsidiary, Alfalah CLSA Securities.\n\n\u201cWe understand the challenges that the company has faced recently, and we want to assure all stakeholders that, as the parent organisation, we stand firmly with it,\u201d it said.\n\nAlfalah CLSA\u2019s financial challenges are being addressed, and we are providing comprehensive financial support to ensure that it continues to operate effectively and fulfil all its obligations to all parties involved, read the statement.\n\n\u201cWe believe in the firm\u2019s strength and resilience and are resolute in our commitment to Alfalah CLSA Securities,\u201d it further added.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Strong inter\u00adnational interest following significant progress tow\u00adards privatisation of the national flag carrier and optimism about IMF in\u00adflows early next month further boosted investor confidence triggering a fresh buying spree tossing the benchmark KSE 100-share index to an all-time high closing above 66,500 level.\n\nPreviously, the index did cross the pivotal level several times in recent weeks but could not sustain the gains above that level.\n\nThe approval of the 11-member board of directors of PIA Holding Company with former SBP governor Tariq Bajawa as its chairman by the federal cabinet on Tuesday was considered a major development which would speed up the privatisation of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).\n\nThe cabinet also approved that the liabilities and assets of the loss-making national carrier would be transferred to the holding company, which would be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.\n\nInterestingly, the majority of the independent directors on the holding company\u2019s board are the heads of commercial banks, including Bank Alfalah CEO Atif Aslam Bajwa and United Bank chief executive Shahzad Dada.\n\nSeparately, the aviation ministry confirmed that it had received investor interest in the PIA transaction from several countries including Germany, France, The Netherlands, Qatar, the UAE, Malaysia and Turkiye which also sparked enthusiasm among the local investors.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said besides PIA privatisation, the rupee stability, PM commitments over CPEC second phase and expected foreign inflows also helped the market to scale a new closing peak.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the market finally settled above the pivotal level as investors chose to further strengthen their equity position by buying blue-chip scrips across the board.\n\nResultantly, the power, bank & fertiliser sectors contributed positively to the index as Hub Power, Meezan Bank, United Bank, MCB Bank and Engro Corporation cumulatively added 319 points to the index.\n\nOn the other hand, Pakistan Petroleum, National Bank and Millat Tractors attracted some profit-taking wiping out 67 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at an all-time high of 66,547.79 points after staging a robust rally of 641.51 points or 0.97 per cent from the preceding session. Its previous all-time high closing was 66,427.78 points on Dec 12. 2023.\n\nThe overall trading volume rose further by 16.75pc to 354.59 million shares. The traded value, however, fell 1.60pc to Rs11.88bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Lotte Chemical (42.83m shares), Telecard Ltd (29.17m shares), Pakistan Tele\u00adcomm\u00adunication Com\u00adpany Ltd (24.70m shares), The Organic Meat Company Ltd (18.79m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (16.03m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan (Rs235.00), Shahmurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs31.38), Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs30.32), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs23.92) and Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs11.64).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs240.00), Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs106.50), Unilever Foods (Rs100.00), Hoechst Pakistan (Rs93.87) and Sapphire Textile (Rs84.05).\n\nForeign investors continued picking shares as their next purchase worth $0.33m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 28th, 2024",

            "text": "Bank Alfalah Limited, one of Pakistan\u2019s leading commercial banks, has announced an investment of Rs 1.2 billion in its brokerage subsidiary, Alfalah CLSA Securities (Private) Limited.\n\nThe brokerage house is a sort of partnership between the Abu Dhabi Group-owned Bank Alfalah and CLSA Limited, which is a brokerage house based in Thailand.\n\nThe company is currently running a pure agency brokerage house offering equity brokerage, online trading, commodities trading, research, investment banking, foreign exchange services, money market, and advisory services.\n\nWhy is there a need for such a large investment?\n\nThe recent accounts of Alfalah CLSA show that the company went from making a profit of Rs. 7 million in 2022 to a loss of Rs. 1.1 billion in 2023. The onus of the poor performance lies on the brokerage house\u2019s inability to control operating expenses. Additionally, the company utilized a short-term borrowing facility to increase its exposure margin, leading to a significant rise in finance costs.\n\nIn order to shore up the brokerage house, the bank has decided to invest a large amount. in fact, due to the loss made this year, Alfalah CLSA saw its equity turn negative. In order to shore up investor confidence and to make sure the brokerage house keeps operating, the bank was strengthening the balance sheet.\n\nThis is not the first time such an investment is being made. The bank originally owned 97.91% of the brokerage house when it was incorporated in 2003. Once the house started to perform, right shares were given out to investors which decreased the bank\u2019s shareholding. Financial years of 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 have not been good for the brokerage house as it has made a cumulative loss of Rs. 1 billion which led to the equity turning negative.\n\nBacked by big players\n\nBank Alfalah is one of the largest banks of Pakistan with a network of over 1000 branches across more than 200 cities and has an international presence in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bahrain and UAE. The bank is originally owned by Abu Dhabi Group and has been operating since 1992. The bank owns 61.2% of Alfalah CLSA Securities (Private) Limited and has 40.2% ownership of Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited which is an asset management company of the bank.\n\nCLSA BV was a company founded in 1986 by Jim Walker and Gary Coull who were journalists by profession and are considered to be pioneers of the Asian securities industry and its development. The company has a network spanning Asia, Australia, Europe and United States and has offices in 21 locations around the world. The company is known for its investment advisory and asset management services and has been awarded for its renowned services. CLSA was overtaken by CITIC Securities in 2013. CLSA owns 24.9% of Alfalah CLSA as of today.\n\nCITIC Securities is China\u2019s leading brokerage and investment bank and largest underwriter of Chinese debt and equity. CITIC was founded in 1995 and offers brokerage services, investment banking and asset management to corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals.\n\nThe new investment in perspective\n\nThe investment of Rs. 1.2 billion would be channeled towards purchasing and subscribing additional shares of the brokerage house at Rs. 10 per share. This investment is going to be for an indefinite period.\n\nThe resolution, as mentioned earlier, has been passed which means that an additional 120 million shares in the brokerage house will be issued and subscribed.\n\nThe brokerage house currently has 40 million issued and subscribed shares and would be increasing them to 160 million with Bank Alfalah\u2019s shareholding increasing from 62.5% to 90.6% and decreasing CLSA BV\u2019s share from 24.9% to 6.2%.",

            "text": "Despite higher net income, Bank Alfalah saw its profit fall to Rs9.93 billion during the quarter ended March 31, 2024, which is nearly 8% lower than its earnings in the same period of the previous year.\n\nThe decline in profit-after-tax (PAT) is attributed to much lower foreign exchange income, higher operating expenses, and increased taxation.\n\nAs per the financial statements shared with the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday, the bank reported earnings per share (EPS) of Rs6.31 compared to Rs6.83 in the same period last year.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s profit jumps over 96% in 2023\n\nThe board of directors also announced an interim cash dividend of Rs2 per share i.e. 20%.\n\nThe net interest income of Bank Alfalah rose to Rs30.79 billion in 1QCY24, up over 10% from a year ago, as compared to Rs27.91 billion registered in SPLY.\n\nMeanwhile, the non-interest income of the bank registered a growth of nearly 20% on a year-on-year basis. Non-interest income amounted to Rs8.1 billion, as compared to Rs6.8 billion registered in SPLY.\n\nIn 1QCY24, BAFL generated Rs4.5 billion in fee and commission income, up over 31% compared to last year. Its foreign exchange income also declined to Rs2.3 billion compared to RsRs3.3 billion in January-March quarter of 2023.\n\nDuring the quarter, Bank Alfalah made a total income of Rs38.86 billion, translating into a 12% increase over the earnings recorded in SPLY.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s saw its non-mark-up expenses balloon to Rs19.16 billion in 1QCY24, as compared to Rs15.12 billion in SPLY, a jump of 27% YoY. Its operating expenses, which jumped from Rs14.7 billion to Rs18.5 billion, were a major reason behind the higher non-markup expenses going up.\n\nAs a result, the bank profit before tax clocked in at Rs19.82 billion in 1QCY24, an increase of just 4%.\n\nThe tax expense of Bank Alfalah increased 20% year-on-year to Rs9.88 billion in 1QCY24, in comparison to Rs8.26 billion in SPLY.",

            "text": "After a volatile session at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), strong corporate results helped stocks stage a final-hour rally, pushing the benchmark KSE-100 beyond 62,000 with an over 400-point gain on Thursday.\n\nDuring most part of the day, the benchmark index had remained largely range-bound.\n\nHowever, it picked up traction in the final hour of trading, and at close, the benchmark index settled at 62,393.73, an increase of 414.55 points or 0.67%.\n\nExperts said investor sentiment improved after strong corporate results especially by the index-heavy banking and energy sectors.\n\nShares of index-heavy energy stocks including OGDC and PPL closed in the green alongside scrips of Bank Alfalah and Soneri Bank, which posted significant profit growth.\n\nAt close on Wednesday, the benchmark index retreated amid late selling to close at 61,979.18, an increase of 137.44 points or 0.22%.\n\nExperts said that the market is keenly awaiting the polls, and a rally is expected post-elections.\n\n\u201cThe General Elections 2024 are expected to be held on 8th Feb\u201924, and transition of power to the newly elected government is expected to increase investor confidence in the market,\u201d said Arif Habib Limited (AHL) in a report on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWith the ongoing result season, certain scrips are expected to remain in the limelight on the expectation of robust results,\u201d it added.\n\nPRL posts PAT of over Rs2bn profit in 2QFY24\n\nGlobally, the Asian shares faltered on Thursday after Wall Street took a late spill, while investors stuck to bets for sizable cuts in US interest rates this year even if the kick-off might now be a little later than first hoped.\n\nThe Federal Reserve committee\u2019s decision to hold rates at 5.25-5.5% on Wednesday was no surprise, it took a dovish twist by emphasising that rates would not be cut until it had more confidence that inflation was truly beaten.\n\nIn a media conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell flatly stated a cut as early as March seemed unlikely, but also conceded that everyone on the committee was looking to ease this year.\n\nVolume on the all-share index decreased to 270.5 million from 276.4 million a session before.\n\nThe value of shares increased to Rs11.62 billion from Rs9.27 billion in the previous session.\n\nK-Electric Ltd was the volume leader with 34 million shares, followed by Soneri Bank Ltd with 28.1 million shares, and Pak Refinery at 26.1 million shares.\n\nShares of 346 companies were traded on Thursday, of which 166 registered an increase, 154 recorded a fall, while 26 remained unchanged.",
