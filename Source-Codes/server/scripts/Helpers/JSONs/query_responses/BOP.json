            "text": "KARACHI: On the eve of the formal start of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), gloomy conditions persisted in the stock market due to uncertainty related to the outcome of talks as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index remained under selling pressure extending the overnight losses.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the expected tough review by the IMF mission under the current $3bn Stand-By Arrangement from March 14-18 fuelled market nervousness as cautious investors indulged in profit-taking.\n\nBesides securing the release of the $1.1bn last tranche under the current SBA, Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb would also be discussing with the IMF a fresh longer and larger Extended Fund Facility to address the country\u2019s balance of payments issues.\n\nThe dismal data on automobile sales falling by 41pc in July-February and uncertainty over the possibility of a cut in the interest rate also played a role in the bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the session commenced on a promising note as the index rallied 241.67 points to an intraday high of 65,043 points. However, investors resorted to profit-taking in the closing hours, which swiftly evolved into a widespread selling activity across the board.\n\nSeveral sectors, including exploration & production, automotive, banking, and technology, contributed negatively to the index performance, with companies such as Mari Petroleum Ltd, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, Millat Tractors Ltd, PSO, TRG Pakistan, and Habib Bank collectively shedding 266 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,048.44 points after tumbling by 753.26 points or 1.16 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume fell 21.43pc to 252.75 million shares. The traded value also dipped 14.82pc to Rs9.24bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Cnergyico PK Ltd (19.85m shares), Bank of Punjab (18.74m shares), K-Eectric (14.39m shares), P.I.A.C. (A) (11.75m shares) and Kohinoor Spinning Ltd (11.15m shares).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Allawasaya Textile (Rs108.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs74.57), Nestle Pakistan (Rs49.12), Pakistan Hotels Develo\u00adpers Ltd (Rs38.70) and Pakistan Tobacco Com\u00adpany Ltd (Rs33.59).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakis\u00adtan Foods (Rs200.00), Bata Pakistan (Rs20.00), Shah\u00admurad Sugar Mills (Rs10.80), Bolan Castings Ltd (Rs5.20), Sitara Chemi\u00adcal (Rs5.00). Aggressive buying by foreign investors continued as they purcha\u00adsed shares worth $2.53m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 14th, 2024",

            "short_description": "What\u2019s up at the stock market? A rebuttal  Profit by Pakistan Today",
            "text": "On 14th December, a leading English newspaper published an opinion piece by the title \u201cWhat\u2019s up at the stock market?\u201d The fact that the write-up showed little understanding of the stock market needs no mention. But it becomes alarming when an attempt is made to understand a larger-than-life scenario in a few words. It would be like trying to write a page length summary of War and Peace expecting to get all the nuance and significance of the literary masterpiece.\n\nWhat is in the op-ed?\n\nLet\u2019s start off by trying to understand what the writer has tried to say. The writer admits outright that he rarely writes about the stock market and that he has a pessimistic view even when he does write. This already sets the expectation that he is not going to laud the market for its recent rally.\n\nThe skepticism shown here is warranted to an extent. Too many times in the past, the rally and gains in the stock market have been artificial in nature and have left retail investors holding the short end of the stick. This publication recently did a series on the three stock market crashes seen in a span of nine years at the Karachi Stock Exchange.\n\nSo it is no surprise that the op-ed\u2019s central theme is that the current rise needs to be seen with some suspicion. The rise is seen as being made up of 22,500 points which have primarily been made up of two sectors: banking and energy, where energy includes the fertiliser sector. Banks and energy have a high weightage in the KSE 100 index, and as these companies will see an increase, so will the index.\n\nIs the increase justified by the rise in earnings of these two sectors? The writer highlights the fact that out of Rs 417 billion of profits after tax seen for the first quarter, more than a third are from banks totalling Rs 149 billion, while Rs 30 billion are from oil marketing companies alone. Even based on their past results, this is a huge increase for both sectors. Banks have earned due to high interest rates, while oil marketing companies have profited from the depreciating currency and inventory gains.\n\nThe op-ed also mentions this idea of the \u2018bad broker\u2019, who is seen as being an agent of only a few clients and high net worth individuals. He is responsible for pumping the market in the direction which one or two clients want, while the broker is able to disadvantage all his remaining clientele to benefit a few. There is little economic relevance to the market turning the corner \u2013 instead, it is funded by a few brokers and their clients.\n\nWhat is not in the op-ed?\n\nThe writer leaves out some key insights from his piece which need to be mentioned.\n\nFirst, let us address the earnings question. As mentioned earlier, banks have earned due to high interest rates, while oil marketing companies have profited from the depreciating currency and inventory gains. The writer is correct in regards to the main factor behind the earnings of these two sectors \u2013 but there is a need to widen the scope of the study. The market has still seen a further rise in profits, and the writer fails to take into account the other Rs 238 billion that have been earned in after tax profits. These make up more than 57% of the remaining profits.\n\nSecondly, and more importantly, let us examine the short-term view. It is true that the market has increased from 40,000 points on June 23, 2023 to 66,500 on December 12, 2023, which is an increase of 66.3%. Out of this total increase, 45% is contributed by the banking and energy sector including the fertilizer sector. The remaining 21% has come from the remaining index constituents. Is the writer correct?\n\nNot quite. The KSE 100 index is weighted in such a manner which means that 60% of the weightage is given to the banking and energy sector while the remaining is made up by the rest of the index. This would mean that when index increases by 100 points, 60 points are expected to come from these two sectors while the remaining will come from the other companies. When things are put in that context, it can be expected that the whole index has gained and rather than just a few sectors, the whole index has seen an increase.\n\nWhat is the analysis company wise? Considering the increase seen in individual shares, 18 companies have seen an increase of more than 70% which are part of the banking and energy sector in the period analysed. An additional piece of information that is needed here is the fact that there are also 16 other index constituents which have seen an increase of more than 70% which are not part of these sectors.\n\nCompany Sector Weightage Return K-Electric Limited Energy 0.70% 176.83% Service Industries Limited Leather & Tanneries 0.65% 166.30% Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited Fertilizer 0.64% 155.70% National Refinery Limited Energy 0.41% 150.63% Pak Elektron Limited Cable & Electric 0.50% 148.46% Interloop Limited Textile 0.90% 116.68% Bank AL Habib Limited Bank 2.68% 112.70% Attock Refinery Limited Energy 0.66% 108.41% Pakistan State Oil Company Limited Energy 1.98% 107.88% Askari Bank Limited Bank 0.49% 106.27% Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited Bank 1.19% 106.25% International Steels Limited Steel 0.54% 105.62% International Industries Limited Engineering 0.43% 105.57% Thal Limited Auto 0.52% 105.26% Meezan Bank Limited Bank 3.32% 104.55% Pakistan Petroleum Limited Energy 3.79% 104.04% Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited Paper & Board 0.68% 94.51% National Bank of Pakistan Bank 0.83% 93.89% Unity Foods Limited Food & Personal Care 0.49% 91.31% Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd IT 0.41% 90.81% The Bank of Punjab Bank 0.50% 89.66% The Hub Power Company Limited Energy 5.42% 87.89% Pak-Gulf Leasing Company Limited Financial Services 0.00% 83.45% Habib Bank Limited Bank 3.38% 81.49% Cnergyico PK Limited Energy 0.46% 79.57% Bank Alfalah Limited Bank 1.67% 79.34% Kohinoor Textile Mills Limited Textile 0.23% 79.13% Yousaf Weaving Mills Limited Textile 0.01% 76.32% Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited Energy 1.02% 74.15% Pakistan International Bulk Terminal Transport 0.30% 73.57% Standard Chartered Bank (Pak) Ltd Bank 0.32% 73.10% Frieslandcampina Engro Pakistan Limited Food & Personal Care 0.33% 72.58% Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited Financial Services 0.27% 71.14% Fauji Cement Company Limited Cement 0.80% 71.08%\n\nSimilarly, once accounting for weightages, 23 companies from the banking and energy sector contributed more than 0.5% each and 13 other companies also increased by more than 0.5% each. In short, it can be seen that it is not only these two sectors which have contributed to the gain but other sectors have also contributed to the increase.\n\nCompany Sector Weightage Return Weighted Return The Hub Power Company Limited Energy 5.42% 87.89% 4.76% Pakistan Petroleum Limited Energy 3.79% 104.04% 3.94% Meezan Bank Limited Bank 3.32% 104.55% 3.47% Bank AL Habib Limited Bank 2.68% 112.70% 3.02% Habib Bank Limited Bank 3.38% 81.49% 2.75% United Bank Limited Bank 3.99% 68.02% 2.71% Oil & Gas Development Company Limited Energy 3.72% 68.20% 2.54% MCB Bank Limited Bank 3.56% 68.74% 2.45% Pakistan State Oil Company Limited Energy 1.98% 107.88% 2.14% Lucky Cement Limited Cement 3.46% 57.58% 1.99% Millat Tractors Limited Auto 2.55% 64.47% 1.64% Engro Fertilizers Limited Fertilizer 3.11% 43.33% 1.35% Bank Alfalah Limited Bank 1.67% 79.34% 1.32% Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited Bank 1.19% 106.25% 1.26% K-Electric Limited Energy 0.70% 176.83% 1.24% Mari Petroleum Company Limited Energy 2.61% 44.34% 1.16% Engro Corporation Limited Fertilizer 3.98% 27.37% 1.09% Service Industries Limited Leather & Tanneries 0.65% 166.30% 1.08% Interloop Limited Textile 0.90% 116.68% 1.05% Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited Fertilizer 0.64% 155.70% 1.00% Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited Fertilizer 3.83% 23.83% 0.91% Colgate-Palmolive (Pakistan) Limited FMCG 1.82% 49.68% 0.90% National Bank of Pakistan Bank 0.83% 93.89% 0.78% Dawood Hercules Corporation Limited Fertilizer 2.01% 38.16% 0.77% Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited Energy 1.02% 74.15% 0.76% Pak Elektron Limited Cable & Electric 0.50% 148.46% 0.74% Attock Refinery Limited Energy 0.66% 108.41% 0.72% Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited Paper & Board 0.68% 94.51% 0.64% National Refinery Limited Energy 0.41% 150.63% 0.62% Systems Limited IT 3.60% 16.35% 0.59% International Steels Limited Steel 0.54% 105.62% 0.57% Fauji Cement Company Limited Cement 0.80% 71.08% 0.57% D.G.

From the period of June till December, there were 48 companies which saw a return of more than 100%. Banking and energy only made up 10 of these companies while the remaining were companies that trade on the stock market but are not part of the KSE 100 index..\n\nThe writer posits that most of the index has seen a rise which is based on just two sectors. But in fact the stock market has actually seen a much wider sale increase in both index related and shares not part of the index.\n\nThis can lead to additional worries of bubbles being created, and that can be addressed with mechanisms developed by the stock exchange. However, this does not mean that the index has only increased due to movement in these two sectors.\n\nThe evil stockbroker\n\nThe second part of the op-ed deals with the notion that the evil stock brokers are able to dictate the movement of shares. These are stock brokers who are able to game the system for some of their clients, and benefit a few among them.\n\nI strongly disagree with this notion. The fact of the matter is that no broker in the market is so large that he can cause and sustain a rally of this magnitude for this long. As already shown, the movement is taking place all across the board and no broker has the resources to be able to lead to such a sustained rally by themself. Even if they are able to join forces, they still do not have the capital to be able to lead to a rally like the one seen recently.\n\nEven if it is agreed upon that clients are being disadvantaged by selling snake oil to smaller investors, how is this model sustainable? Once this rally is over, and one is able to dupe retail investors in losing their money, how will the broker sustain himself in the future?\n\nHere, let us recap what the market is and who its participants are. On the face of it, the market is made up of buyers and sellers. In order to buy from the market, there has to be someone who is willing to sell their shares.\n\nBut it is important to understand who is buying and who is selling. Pakistan is able to get investments from outside its own borders where foreigners can trade in the stock market. This is known as Foreign Investors Portfolio Investments (FIPI). Similarly, when local investors invest in the market, these are known as Local Investors Portfolio Investment (LIPI). Both these categories are made up of individuals and corporations who invest and divest their shares in the market. In terms of LIPI, trade data is also broken down for individuals, companies, banks, non-banking financial companies, mutual funds, brokers themselves, insurance companies and other organizations that might wish to invest in the stock market.\n\nThe trade data for FIPI from June 23, 2023 to December 15, 2023 shows that foreigners were net buyers of $72 million. This means that foreign investors, who have their own research to back their decision making of investment, invested in the market. Brokers can have the best manipulative powers in the world but to make a foreign investor fall for your trap would seem highly unlikely. Foreign investors have a long term view towards investment and have to justify their investment rather than say \u2018the broker asked me to invest\u2019.\n\nIn terms of LIPI, most of the buying was carried out by companies and insurance companies, while individuals and brokers sold their shares. Again, seeing only the sale would point towards shares being offloaded but the shares were bought by companies and insurance companies who have investment committee and advisory bodies who dictate how investment has to be carried out. The investment committees have to rationalize every investment decision before they follow through on it.\n\nThe need for a better understanding\n\nIt might seem like a good idea to have someone to blame and someone to target when a rally is going on in the market. After all, if an asset bubble is being created, the best course of action would be to point it out to investors beforehand.\n\nThe problem begins when an incomplete picture is used to make a judgment. Just like the tail of three blind men seeing something different rather than the elephant in the room, there is a need to take all factors into consideration before a judgment is made.\n\nThe real winners, losers and the one left \u2018holding the bag\u2019 will be revealed in due time. Even I don\u2019t feign to know the actual reasons behind this rally and am able to separate the fact from fiction. However, the op-ed feels like a knee jerk reaction on the basis of few facts, and it fails to take into account all factors relevant in this rally. This rebuttal is a small attempt to provide some reason to the recent rise.",

The dwindling inflows are set against the backdrop of import expenditures that are twice as high as exports.\n\nAmreen Soorani, head of research at JS Global, noted that the index had rallied by more than 60pc this year. \u201cTherefore, investors are bound to book profits at some point as witnessed since the past trade sessions,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cA correction after a sharp rise can be healthy for the market. The index is still undervalued and has upside on the cards, in addition to attractive dividend yield picks,\u201d she added.\n\nRaza Jafri, head of equities at Intermarket Securities, told Dawn.com that Pakistan was entering a \u201ccritical phase\u201d in the next few months where it would have to navigate elections and enter the successor International Monetary Fund programme in a \u201ctimely manner\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe remain positive across 2024, but there can be nervous days in the near term, especially given the market\u2019s quick run-up in the last few months,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Investors resorted to profit-taking on the Pakistan Stock Exchange on Monday, which resulted in the benchmark of major shares closing on the lower side.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the KSE-100 index experienced fluctuations within a range of 1,521 points during the trading session. Negative contributions to the benchmark came from stocks in exploration and production, fertiliser and banking sectors.\n\nAccording to Arif Habib Corporation analyst Ahsan Mehanti, institutions booked profit in overbought scrips amid a slump in global crude prices and concerns about the fate of structural reforms post-general elections.\n\nMoreover, the large-scale manufacturing index falling by 4.1 per cent year-on-year in October as well as the government deciding to further raise the industrial gas tariff for curbing the circular debt played the role of a catalyst in the bearish close.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 65,204.68 points after losing 925.35 points or 1.4pc from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume increased 8.5pc to 1.8 billion shares. The traded value decreased 17.9pc to Rs24.6bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom Ltd (444.1m shares), K-Electric Ltd (392.7m shares), Cynergyico PK Ltd (205.4m shares), Hascol Petroleum Ltd (123.9m shares) and the Bank of Punjab Ltd (91.7m shares).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hoechst Pakistan Ltd (Rs49), Mehmood Textile Mills Ltd (Rs25), Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs20), Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (Rs19.40) and Gatron Industries Ltd (Rs10).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs250), Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs142.50), Faisal Spinning Mills Ltd (Rs30), Bata Pakistan Ltd (Rs21.11) and Service Industries Ltd (Rs20.61).\n\nForeign investors were net buyers as they purchased shares worth $1.2m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, December 19th, 2023",

            "text": "KARACHI: Leveraged buyers led a selling spree at the Pakistan Stock Excha\u00adnge on Tuesday, resulting in the biggest day-on-day decline in the benchmark of major shares.\n\nThe KSE-100 index dropped 2,534 points or 4.1 per cent from the preceding session to 59,170.97 points, down 11pc from an all-time high of 66,427 points on Dec 12.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Topline Securities Ltd CEO Mohammed Sohail said high leverage was the key reason for the sharp drop in share prices on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cGreedy investors descend upon the market every time stock prices go up too quickly,\u201d he said while referring to leveraged traders who use borrowed funds to buy shares. They liquidate their positions in large numbers once the market enters a correction \u2014 signalled by a drop of 5-20pc in average share prices \u2014 as they\u2019re required to deposit additional cash with their brokers to cover possible losses.\n\nIndex down 11pc from its peak on Dec 12\n\nThe total leverage position in the exchange climbed down 8.2pc from last Friday to Rs32.7 billion at the end of Tuesday\u2019s session.\n\nCiting data from the morning of Tuesday, Mr Sohail said futures contracts for December amou\u00adnted to more than Rs20bn.\n\nFutures contracts allow investors to trade eligible underlying shares with the actual delivery of the same securities occurring at the expiry of the contract, which is the end of every month.\n\nTherefore, investors holding December contracts have until the end of this week, which coincides with the end of December, to either settle their positions or roll them over to the next month.\n\n\u201cI see a rebound in the index later this week, even though investors still have three days in which they can settle their December contracts,\u201d he said.\n\nAccording to Arif Habib Ltd, the KSE-100 index going below the 60,000-point level is \u201csignificant\u201d. \u201cWe are now on alert to watch for signs of bottoming and the resumption of upside,\u201d it said in its market commentary.\n\nThe drawdown for the KSE-100 index has now extended beyond 10pc, which is historically the turning point in bull markets, it said while showing optimism about the end of the index\u2019s correction\n\nof more than 7,000 points during the last couple of weeks.\n\nTrade data showed individuals as a category of investors were the biggest sellers as they disposed of equities worth $5.9 million. Other major sellers were mutual funds ($3m) and companies ($1.1m).\n\nThe categories of investors who bought up shares in large quantities were banks ($4.5m), brokers ($2.9m) and insurance firms ($1m). Foreign investors remained net buyers as they purchased shares worth over $1m. However, nearly all of that inflow originated from overseas Pakistanis as foreign corporates made a net purchase of only $0.03m.\n\nThe overall trading volume remained flat on a day-on-day basis at 670.8m shares. The traded value increased 25pc to Rs17.1bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included K-Electric Ltd (97.3m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (72.5m shares), the Bank of Punjab Ltd (41m shares), Cynergyico PK Ltd (39.8m shares) and Fauji Foods Ltd (37.9m shares).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs355), Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs106), Mari Petrol\u00adeum Company Ltd (Rs94.63), Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs78) and Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs38).\n\nPublished in Dawn, December 27th, 2023",

            "text": "KARACHI: The benchmark of major shares galloped higher on Tuesday, crossing the psychological barrier of 60,000 points for the first time in history.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Topline Securities Ltd CEO Mohammed Sohail said the rally in stock prices witnessed since the beginning of 2023-24 has been one of the fastest in the last two decades.\n\nOne of the key reasons for the steep rise in share prices is unusual foreign buying. Dollar inflows, especially from overseas corporate investors, have helped sustain the rally that has tossed the index up by more than 38 per cent in the last five months alone.\n\nFor perspective, net foreign investment in the stock market since the beginning of July has been $36 million versus only $2.5m recorded in the preceding January-June period.\n\nOf all PSX-listed shares worth roughly $30 billion, holdings by foreign investors currently account for $1.3bn or 4.3pc. \u201cDespite incessant foreign buying in recent months, their holdings in the PSX are still nowhere close to the level of 2017,\u201d he said.\n\nThe value of all PSX-listed shares in 2017 hovered around $100bn when foreign investors controlled a share of roughly 10pc or $10bn at the time.\n\n\u201cValuations also continue to be low because corporate earnings have risen at such a fast pace,\u201d he said while referring to the rather depressed price-to-earnings multiple \u2014 a ratio that measures a company\u2019s share value relative to its per-share income.\n\nThe constituent stocks of the KSE-100 index are still trading at a multiple of four times their collective earnings, a level that\u2019s half the 10-year average of eight.\n\n\u201cI expect the KSE-100 index to hit 75,000 points by December 2024,\u201d said Mr Sohail.\n\nOne key threat to this forecast is Islamabad returning to fiscal mismanagement after the conclusion of the ongoing International Monetary Fund loan programme early next year. Failure to execute a peaceful transfer of power in the coming months constitutes another big threat to the stock market rally, he added.\n\nThe KSE-100 index closed at 60,730.26 points after gaining 918.92 points or 1.54pc from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume increased 18.5pc to 779.6m shares. The traded value increased 28.9pc to Rs26.1bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Kohinoor Spinning Mills Ltd (79.2m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (57.4m shares), the Bank of Punjab Ltd (44.3m shares), Cnergyico PK Ltd (31.3m shares) and Treet Corp\u00adoration Ltd (27.2m shares).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hoechst Pakistan Ltd (Rs85), Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs80.28), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs66.37), Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs50) and Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs48.17).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs100), Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs57.05), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (Rs37.19), Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (Rs15.50) and Pakistan Hotels Developers Ltd (Rs15.47).\n\nForeign investors were net buyers as they purchased shares worth $5.08m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 29th, 2023",

Furthermore, whispers of institutional buying circulated, casting a favourable light on the market and contributing to its upward momentum.\n\nA widespread surge of buying activity swept through the market, with banks, fertiliser and exploration & production sectors emerging as the day\u2019s primary beneficiaries where MCB Bank, Meezan Bank Ltd, HabibMetro Bank, Bank Al-Habib, Engro Fertilisers, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Pakistan Oilfield Ltd and Mari Petroleum cumulatively contributed 319 points to the index.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said Pakistan\u2019s targeting of terrorist hideouts inside Afghanistan also boosted market sentiments.\n\nHe added that the reports about the SBP Governor\u2019s assurance for a $2bn rollover in two weeks and plans to seek $4bn further payment rollovers played a catalyst role in the bullish close at the PSX.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 65,502.60 points after staging a rally of 612.09 points or 0.94 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume swelled 52.66pc to 323.28 million shares.

            "text": "After a day of trading in red, the Pakistan Stock Exchange\u2019s benchmark KSE-100 index recovered some of its losses on Wednesday.\n\nAs of 11:42am, the KSE was up 381.55, or 0.75 per cent. Yesterday, it had closed at 51,027.94 points. By close, however, the index settled 149.19 points, or 0.29pc ahead.\n\nOn Monday, the stocks rallied in anticipation of a substantial hike in gas prices by the Economic Coordination Committee. The energy sector was the main player in this surge.\n\nHowever, the index experienced minor losses on Tuesday as investors decided to off-load. The drivers behind the decline were cited to be geopolitical uncertainties and anxiety over the IMF review in November for the $710 million tranche release.\n\nMajor activity was reported in stocks such as Worldcall Telecom Limited, The Bank of Punjab, Fauji Cement Company Limited, Pakistan State Oil Company Limited and Oil & Gas Development Company Limited.\n\nTop advancers included Tri-Star Mutual Fund Limited, Al Shaheer Corporation Limited, Next Capital Limited, Shabbir Tiles & Ceramics Limited and First Punjab Modaraba.\n\nTop decliners included Dewan Sugar Mills Limited, Reliance Weaving Mills Limited, Rupali Polyester Limited, Pakistan Paper Products Limited and Pakistan Hotels Developers Limited.",

On the other hand, Oil and Gas Development Company, Hub Power, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, Bank Al-Habib, United Bank Ltd and PSO wiped out 179 points.\n\nThe index traded between its intraday high of 289 points and low of 248 points. As a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,816.47 points after losing 247.80 points or 0.38 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading dipped 17.72pc to 259.37 million shares.

            "text": "KARACHI: With a resurgence in cut-off yields on treasury bills amid a weak economic outlook, the equity investors on Thursday opted to take profits as a result the KSE could not sustain the early gains above the pivotal 66,000-level and closed in the red.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the government increased the return on three- and 12-month T-bills by up to 60 basis points while the foreign direct investment tumbled 17.1pc to $820.6m for July-February reflecting serious challenges over external financing which contributed to bearish market sentiments.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the equities initiated the day\u2019s affairs on a positive note as the index made an intraday high of 66,196 but it could not hold on the level due to profit-taking.\n\nIt added that the increased yields in the overnight T-bills auction could be the key reason for the market reaction as it shook investors\u2019 confidence regarding the commencement of monetary easing.\n\nOn the global landscape, the US central bank\u2019s Federal Open Market Committee kept its benchmark rate in a range of 5.25pc to 5.5pc by maintaining the status quo in its interest rates decision while giving signal to three cuts in CY24.\n\nExploration & production, tech and cement sectors contributed negatively to the index as Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, Systems Ltd, OGDC, Lucky Cement and Pioneer Cement cumulatively wiped out 185 points from the index. On the flip side, the National Bank of Pakistan, Fauji Fertiliser Company and MCB Bank attracted some buying interest adding 102 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 65,417.40 points after losing 314.39 points or 0.48 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume rose 13.98pc to 389.65 million shares. The traded value, however, dipped 4.53pc to Rs11.30bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (52.89m shares), Pakistan Internation Container Bulk Terminal (41.97m shares), Bank of Punjab (29.10m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (26.66m shares) and Gul Ahmed Textile (20.90m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Pakistan Engineering Company Ltd (Rs38.16), JDW Sugar Mills (Rs31.45), Bata Pakistan Ltd (Rs28.85), Premium Textile Mills Ltd (Rs24.00) and Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs8.64).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs350.01), Khyber Textile Mills Ltd (Rs49.66), Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs35.00), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs25.70) and Shahmurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs24.29).\n\nForeign investors turned net buyers as they picked shares worth $1.81m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 22nd, 2024",

            "text": "KARACHI: The stock market came under pressure on Friday amid speculations about the interest rate direction and declining energy prices.\n\nArif Habib Corporation Ltd analyst Ahsan Mehanti said the pressure on listed companies was due to the next announcement of the key interest rate scheduled for Oct 30 as well as falling global crude oil prices.\n\nFactors like a weakening rupee and reduced foreign exchange reserves, which dropped to $7.5 billion as per the latest announcement, contributed to the pessimism on the bourse.\n\nThe highest economic decision-making body\u2019s decision for a massive hike in the industrial gas tariff amid the Rs4.5 trillion circular debt in the energy sector also played the role of a catalyst in the bearish close.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 50,943.84 points after losing 241.44 points or 0.47 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume decreased 3.6pc to 350.8 million shares.

            "text": "The Federal Shariat Court ruling in April 2022 to eliminate interest from the economy by December 2027 marked a pivotal moment in Pakistan\u2019s financial landscape. The judgment declared an unequivocal prohibition of Riba (including banking interest) in all its manifestations and forms, setting a target to transform the nation into an interest-free economy by the end of 2027. This historic decision necessitates amendments to align all laws and regulations with the essence of this judgment.\n\nThe Federal Shariat Court (FSC) has further ruled that upcoming financial dealings involving Pakistan, be it financing or contracts with international financial bodies, should also adhere to Shariah-compliant financial methods, such as the issuance of Sukuk. This signifies a significant shift towards embracing Islamic finance principles in the country\u2019s financial engagements.\n\nIn Pakistan, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Islamic banking industry assets have crossed the benchmark of Rs8.1 trillion by June 2023 (approximately $29bn), while the overall Islamic finance industry is reaching close to the Rs10tr mark by adding the market share for the Islamic mutual funds, Sukuk, Modaraba, Islamic Real Estate Investment Trusts and Takaful sectors.\n\nAccording to SBP statistics, at the start of 2002, the Islamic banking industry assets were Rs 5.5tr while deposits were Rs4.2tr with over 5,350 branches. The FSC judgment has provided a positive growth impetus to the industry that grew by over Rs2.5tr in asset size and over Rs1.6tr in terms of deposits in just 18 months, reaching Rs8.1tr in total assets and deposits of over Rs5.8tr.\n\nPakistan is steadily moving towards Shariah compliance across all financial sectors\n\nThe Islamic banking branch network also expanded by 970 branches in just 18 months to make the overall network of Islamic banking branches close to 6,400. The positive growth is likely to continue, with more big banks now eyeing conversion to Islamic banking.\n\nThe growth numbers not only reflect the strength of the value proposition offered by Islamic banking and finance but also reflect the strong grassroots demand for Shariah-compliant financial services and wider acceptance of the conversion roadmap provided by the Shariat Court.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has also taken the front seat and is taking steps to convert the non-banking financial sector to Islamic principles. Post FSC judgment, the commission issued the Islamic Finance Diagnostic Report early at the start of 2023 and recently issued Guidelines for Offering Islamic Financial Service 2023, while the Islamic Finance department at SECP is working on several initiatives for conversion.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance is also actively working with State-Owned Entities (SOEs) towards formulating conversion strategies to transform their existing financial dealings into the realm of Islamic Finance. This transformative drive reflects a significant commitment to fostering Islamic Finance within the public sector, reshaping the financial landscape in Pakistan.\n\nThe central bank has also provided detailed guidelines and regulatory standards to facilitate conventional banks\u2019 desire to convert their operations as per Shariah principles. The SBP has also played a pivotal role in not only guiding but also facilitating the smooth transition of financial institutions into the Islamic finance realm.\n\nAn exemplary case in point is the remarkable conversion of Faysal Bank Limited to a complete Islamic bank by Dec 2022. This transformation is an unprecedented milestone in Pakistan\u2019s banking history, where a large conventional institution embraced Shariah-compliant principles.\n\nRecently, Summit Bank has announced a conversion to an Islamic bank, and according to news sources, a few other banks, including The Bank of Punjab, ZTBL, and a foreign bank operating in Pakistan, are also considering a complete shift towards becoming Islamic banks.\n\nThe FSC judgment effectively underscores various Sukuk types that the government can utilise in international capital markets to convert existing foreign currency debt and secure new international financing. This guidance is invaluable in facilitating these financial transactions.\n\nThe government has predominantly leaned on bank credit to meet its budgetary requirements, with investments in government securities comprising approximately 48 per cent of the banking sector\u2019s asset base as of the end of December 2022.\n\nA significant portion of these investments primarily involves conventional Market Treasury Bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds, which make up 87.3pc of the banks\u2019 overall holdings in government securities, while Sukuk constitute a relatively smaller share at 12.7pc.\n\nAfter the FSC judgment, the Pakistani government increased its focus on issuing Shariah-compliant Sukuk to replace its interest-based borrowing. In FY22, the government introduced a remarkable 23 Sukuks and successfully raised Rs1.34tr. Fast forward to 2023, in the last nine months, 24 new Sukuk were issued worth Rs1.07tr, taking the total sovereign Sukuk issuance to Rs5.051tr.\n\nThe impact of the FSC judgment and increased acceptance of Islamic finance can be witnessed at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), which now hosts two Islamic indices, namely the KMI-30 index and KMI-All Share Islamic Index to screen the listed companies in line with Shariah guidelines for investments in equities.\n\nThe market capitalisation of Shariah-compliant equities has reached 65pc of the overall market cap by June 2023, showing a positive shift in the corporate sector and increased acceptability of Islamic financial solutions.\n\nAccording to the SECP, the Islamic mutual fund industry is also witnessing robust growth. It has achieved an impressive 45pc market share, while the Shariah-compliant pension funds, targeting retail investors, command a majority market share of 65pc with assets under management of over Rs32 billion by June 30, 2023.\n\nIn conclusion, Pakistan\u2019s embrace of Islamic finance and its journey towards an interest-free economy, driven by the FSC\u2019s historic ruling, is not only reshaping the nation\u2019s financial landscape but also holds great promise for the future.\n\nMr Siddiqui is the Director at IBA\u2019s Centre for Excellence in Islamic Finance.\n\nEmail: aasiddiqui@iba.edu.pk.
