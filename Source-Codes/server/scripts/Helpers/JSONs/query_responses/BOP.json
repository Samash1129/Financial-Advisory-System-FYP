            "text": "After a week of uncertainty, bearish sentiment returned to the trading floor of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday as shares opened the week in the red.\n\nAccording to the PSX website, the KSE-100 index declined by 925.35 points to close at 65,204.67 points, down 1.4 per cent from the previous close of 66,130.02.\n\nTop active stocks included Worldcall Telecom Limited, K-Electric Limited, Cnergyico PK Limited, Hascol Petroleum Limited and The Bank of Punjab.\n\nThe stock market observed a roller coaster ride last week, closing at 66,130 points after declining by 94 points or 0.14pc from a week ago.\n\nAccording to analysts, anxiety over the strained rupee position amid rising demand and poor inflows of dollars has increased. The dwindling inflows are set against the backdrop of import expenditures that are twice as high as exports.\n\nAmreen Soorani, head of research at JS Global, noted that the index had rallied by more than 60pc this year. \u201cTherefore, investors are bound to book profits at some point as witnessed since the past trade sessions,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cA correction after a sharp rise can be healthy for the market. The index is still undervalued and has upside on the cards, in addition to attractive dividend yield picks,\u201d she added.\n\nRaza Jafri, head of equities at Intermarket Securities, told Dawn.com that Pakistan was entering a \u201ccritical phase\u201d in the next few months where it would have to navigate elections and enter the successor International Monetary Fund programme in a \u201ctimely manner\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe remain positive across 2024, but there can be nervous days in the near term, especially given the market\u2019s quick run-up in the last few months,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Equity prices staged a strong rebound at the Pakistan Stock Exchange on Tuesday thanks to the policy rate status quo and optimism about the imminent Staff-Level Agreement with the IMF following the wrapping of the final review.\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s decision to maintain the policy rate at 22pc for the sixth consecutive monetary policy review boosted the market confidence as enthusiastic investors picked shares at attractive levels triggering an across-the-board buying spree.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the KSE-100 index opened on a positive note as it gained 734.22 points in early trade. Furthermore, whispers of institutional buying circulated, casting a favourable light on the market and contributing to its upward momentum.\n\nA widespread surge of buying activity swept through the market, with banks, fertiliser and exploration & production sectors emerging as the day\u2019s primary beneficiaries where MCB Bank, Meezan Bank Ltd, HabibMetro Bank, Bank Al-Habib, Engro Fertilisers, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Pakistan Oilfield Ltd and Mari Petroleum cumulatively contributed 319 points to the index.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said Pakistan\u2019s targeting of terrorist hideouts inside Afghanistan also boosted market sentiments.\n\nHe added that the reports about the SBP Governor\u2019s assurance for a $2bn rollover in two weeks and plans to seek $4bn further payment rollovers played a catalyst role in the bullish close at the PSX.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 65,502.60 points after staging a rally of 612.09 points or 0.94 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume swelled 52.66pc to 323.28 million shares. The traded value also surged by 119.12pc to Rs17.05bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom (27.82m shares), Telecard Ltd (20.82m shares), The Bank of Punjab (17.91m shares), Hascol Petroleum Ltd (16.62m shares) and Unity Foods Ltd (15.91m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs200.00), Pakistan Tobacco (Rs67.20), Indus Motor Ltd (Rs48.58), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs47.90) and Mehmood Textile (Rs16.82).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Sapphire Fibres Ltd(Rs91.67), Nest\u00adle Pakis\u00adtan (Rs80.00), Ibrahim Fib\u00adres (Rs29.92), Murree Bre\u00adwery (Rs6.48) and Dawood Lawrencepur (Rs5.62).\n\nForeign investors remained net sellers as they offloaded shares worth $1.65m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 20th, 2024",

            "text": "KARACHI: Bears maintained a firm grip on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for the third consecutive session on Thursday, dragging the benchmark KSE 100 share index below the 71,000 level amid persisting gloomy conditions.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said unabated institutional profit-taking continued to fuel bearish sentiments after a slump in global crude oil prices and dismal external trade data.\n\nExports fell 9pc month-on-month to $2.35bn in April, while the trade deficit more than doubled to $2.374bn from $846m in the same month last year.\n\nHe added that uncertainty about talks with the International Monetary Fund for a new $8bn Extended Fund Facility, weak earnings outlook amid surging energy prices and reports of disagreement among coalition partners on the privatisation policy contributed to a bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said sectors such as technology and fertiliser contributed to the index\u2019s decline, with TRG Pakistan, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Engro Fertilisers, Engro Corpo\u00adration and Systems Ltd collectively wiping out 248 points. Conversely, Bank Alfalah Ltd, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, and Interloop Ltd added 103 points.\n\nAs a result, the index hit an intraday high of 71,292.83 and a low of 70,562.12. However, it closed at 70,657.64 points after shedding 444.91 points, or 0.63pc, from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume dipped 22.04pc to 436.99 million shares. The traded value also fell 26.06pc to Rs19.02bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included K-Electric (30.10m shares), Worldcall Telecom (25.12m shares), The Bank of Punjab (20.16m shares), Pakistan Inter\u00adnational Airlines (15.72m shares) and Faysal Bank Ltd (14.05m shares).\n\nThe shares registering the most significant decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakitan Foods Ltd (Rs717.85), Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs86.15), Sapphire Textile Ltd (Rs34.90), Mari Petroleum (Rs31.65) and Pak Tobacco (Rs23.79).\n\nThe companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Sapphire Fibres (Rs56.42), Khyber Tobacco (Rs20.25), Atlas Honda (Rs16.72), Ghand\u00adhara Ind (Rs15.86) and Bolan Castings (Rs9.48).\n\nForeign investors continued aggressive buying as their net purchases of shares stood at $2.85m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 3rd, 2024",

            "text": "KARACHI: The overnight reaching of a consensus between PML-N and PPP on the formation of a coalition government, dubbed PDM 2.0, brought clarity on the political front to a greater extent as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index staged a robust rally to settle above 61,000 level on Wednesday.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the stock market maintained a positive tre\u00adnd throughout the session reaching an intraday high of 61,621 and a low of 60,907 points as optimist investors began strengthening their positions hoping the power-sharing formula of the next government would end the uncertainty.\n\nThis upward movement was driven by Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd, Lucky Cement, Pakis\u00adtan Petroleum Ltd, United Bank Ltd and TRG Paki\u00adstan, collectively contributing 322 points to the index\u2019s rally. Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said rep\u00adorts of reduction in profit rates on the national savings schemes and surging Pakistan Eurobonds also boosted market sentiments.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 61,559.16 points after rallying by 1,094.91 points or 1.81 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume eased 0.45pc to 362.77 million shares. The traded value, however, soared 14.31pc to Rs12.49bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Bank of Punjab (35.43m shares), K-Electric (28.61m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (21.42m shares), Cnergyico PK Ltd (18.30m shares) and The Searle Company Ltd (17.62m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Indus Motor Com\u00adpany Ltd (Rs53.66), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs\u00ad45.11), Highnoon Labo\u00adrato\u00adries (Rs37.90), Service Ind\u00adu\u00ads\u00ad\u00adtries Ltd (Rs37.44) and Abbott Laboratories (Rs33.38).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs50.00), Thal Ltd (Rs9.46), Tata Textile Mills Ltd (Rs5.30), Gadoon Textile Mills Ltd (Rs4.40) and Ittehad Chemicals Ltd (Rs3.43).\n\nForeign investors rema\u00adined net sellers as they offlo\u00adaded shares worth $0.14m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 22nd, 2024",

This development knocked down the market\u2019s positive momentum with a feather.\n\nExploration and production, power, bank and fertiliser sectors contributed negatively to the index as Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, Hub Power, UBL and Engro Corporation lost 438 points, cumulatively.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said default risks amid political instability, policy uncertainty and massive gas price hike delivered by the ECC to meet an IMF deadline to recover an additional Rs242bn from gas consumers, mainly industries played a catalyst role in bearish close.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 61,020.06 points after tumbling by 1,133.78 points or 1.82 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume rose 13.57pc to 345.12 million shares.

            "text": "KARACHI: The benchmark of major shares galloped higher on Tuesday, crossing the psychological barrier of 60,000 points for the first time in history.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Topline Securities Ltd CEO Mohammed Sohail said the rally in stock prices witnessed since the beginning of 2023-24 has been one of the fastest in the last two decades.\n\nOne of the key reasons for the steep rise in share prices is unusual foreign buying. Dollar inflows, especially from overseas corporate investors, have helped sustain the rally that has tossed the index up by more than 38 per cent in the last five months alone.\n\nFor perspective, net foreign investment in the stock market since the beginning of July has been $36 million versus only $2.5m recorded in the preceding January-June period.\n\nOf all PSX-listed shares worth roughly $30 billion, holdings by foreign investors currently account for $1.3bn or 4.3pc. \u201cDespite incessant foreign buying in recent months, their holdings in the PSX are still nowhere close to the level of 2017,\u201d he said.\n\nThe value of all PSX-listed shares in 2017 hovered around $100bn when foreign investors controlled a share of roughly 10pc or $10bn at the time.\n\n\u201cValuations also continue to be low because corporate earnings have risen at such a fast pace,\u201d he said while referring to the rather depressed price-to-earnings multiple \u2014 a ratio that measures a company\u2019s share value relative to its per-share income.\n\nThe constituent stocks of the KSE-100 index are still trading at a multiple of four times their collective earnings, a level that\u2019s half the 10-year average of eight.\n\n\u201cI expect the KSE-100 index to hit 75,000 points by December 2024,\u201d said Mr Sohail.\n\nOne key threat to this forecast is Islamabad returning to fiscal mismanagement after the conclusion of the ongoing International Monetary Fund loan programme early next year. Failure to execute a peaceful transfer of power in the coming months constitutes another big threat to the stock market rally, he added.\n\nThe KSE-100 index closed at 60,730.26 points after gaining 918.92 points or 1.54pc from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume increased 18.5pc to 779.6m shares. The traded value increased 28.9pc to Rs26.1bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Kohinoor Spinning Mills Ltd (79.2m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (57.4m shares), the Bank of Punjab Ltd (44.3m shares), Cnergyico PK Ltd (31.3m shares) and Treet Corp\u00adoration Ltd (27.2m shares).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hoechst Pakistan Ltd (Rs85), Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs80.28), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs66.37), Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs50) and Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs48.17).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs100), Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs57.05), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (Rs37.19), Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (Rs15.50) and Pakistan Hotels Developers Ltd (Rs15.47).\n\nForeign investors were net buyers as they purchased shares worth $5.08m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 29th, 2023",

            "short_description": "Stocks undergo sharp correction on profit-taking  The Express Tribune",
            "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday made a big correction, which was long overdue, as investors offloaded their holdings at higher valuations following a record-eclipsing rally in recent weeks.\n\nInstitutional profit-taking mounted pressure on the market, which tumbled nearly 1,150 points, amid concerns over potential delay and uncertainty about reform plans. The day commenced on a positive note as the KSE-100 index saw an initial surge, which led it to the intra-day high at 67,093.96 points. However, the momentum evaporated very quickly when bears took over as warnings by Fitch Ratings and renewed political volatility weighed on investors\u2019 mind.\n\nSelling pressure was also fuelled by highly leveraged positions and the elevated leverage rates at the PSX as well as a decline in remittances. There were also worries about failing to implement reforms agreed with the IMF.\n\nResultantly, the index descended to the intra-day low at 64,427.38 points later in the day. Sectors like fertiliser, technology, banks, and E&P faced significant selling pressure. Despite substantial losses, the index closed above the 65,000 mark as value-hunting emerged near the end of trading that provided some support.\n\n\u201cPressure was witnessed at the PSX on institutional profit-taking as investors weighed Fitch warnings over the risk of delay and uncertainty about recent reforms and renewed political volatility due to the past record of failing to implement or reversing the reforms agreed with the IMF,\u201d said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.\n\n\u201cHigh leverage and high leverage rates, and falling remittances also played the role of catalysts in bearish close of the market.\u201d At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded losses of 1,146.62 points, or 1.73%, and settled at 65,280.16.\n\nTopline Securities wrote that Pakistan equities had an adventurous day where initially bulls resumed their march and assisted the KSE-100 index to reach intra-day high at 67,093. However, suddenly, bears entered the market with a bang as the index not only shed morning gains but also came off sharply at the intra-day low, it said.\n\nFertiliser, technology, bank and E&P sectors faced considerable headwinds where Engro Fertilisers, Fauji Fertiliser, TRG Pakistan, Meezan Bank and Mari Petroleum erased 368 points from the index.\n\nRead PSX rebounds strongly on policy rate status quo\n\nOn the other hand, Pakistan Oilfields, Hub Power and Pakistan Telecommunication Company saw some buying interest as they added 61 points, Topline added.\n\nArif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, said the PSX saw \u201ca sharp move lower as the resistance at 66,600 held firm to set up a move towards support at 64,000.\u201d\n\nThe biggest negative contributors were Engro Fertilisers (-4.01%), Fauji Fertiliser (-3.14%) and TRG Pakistan (-6.22%) while the major advancers were Pakistan Oilfields (+1.35%), Hub Power (+0.54%) and Pakistan Telecommunication Co (+9.08%), it added.\n\nJS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that the bourse witnessed a sharp correction. \u201cWe advise investors to exercise caution and consider waiting for dips before making fresh buying.\u201d\n\nOverall trading volumes increased to 1.4 billion shares against Tuesday\u2019s tally of 969.6 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs37.7 billion.\n\nShares of 412 companies were traded. Of these, 93 stocks closed higher, 304 dropped and 15 remained unchanged.\n\nWorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 153.7 million shares, losing Rs0.13 to close at Rs1.65, followed by The Bank of Punjab with 106.3 million shares, gaining Rs0.24 to close at Rs6.29 and K-Electric with 90.1 million shares, losing Rs0.02 to close at Rs4.52. Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs530.9 million, according to the NCCPL.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, December 14th, 2023.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",

            "text": "KARACHI: The rejection of the summary for convening a National Assem\u00adbly session by Presi\u00addent Arif Alvi ended the overnight political optimism for the smooth formation of the PML-N-PPP coalition government in the Centre, as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed the topsy-turvy session in the red on Tuesday.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said stocks remained under pressure amid growing uncertainty over the political outcome of the president\u2019s refusal, which triggered profit-taking by a section of investors.\n\nHe said lack of clarity about IMF conditions for a new bailout package, concerns over high inflation and hike in gas prices for industries also contributed to the market\u2019s bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said throughout the session, the index experienced a mixed pattern, hitting a high of 63,622 and a low of 63,055 levels.\n\nThe decline in the index was influenced by Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd, Service Industries Ltd, United Bank Ltd, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, and PSO, contributing 207 points to the index performance. Conversely, TRG Pakis\u00adtan, Mari Petroleum Ltd and Kot Addu Power added 113 points cumulatively.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 63,219.10 points after losing 86.84 points or 0.14 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume dipped by 9.47pc to 409.96 million shares. The traded value also fell by 11.01pc to Rs14.67bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Bank of Punjab(47.57m shares), K-Electric (40.63m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (25.79m shares), Kohinoor Spinning Mills Ltd (23.30m shares) and Pakistan International Bulk Terminal (22.77m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs200.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs45.21), ZIL Ltd (Rs14.99), Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs14.90) and Sitara Chemical Industries (Rs11.00).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs339.00), Hoechst Pakistan Ltd (Rs61.40), Service Industries Ltd (Rs50.25), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs30.00) and Blessed Textiles Ltd (Rs24.52).\n\nForeign investors remained net buyers as they purchased shares worth $0.71m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 28th, 2024",

            "text": "The Federal Shariat Court ruling in April 2022 to eliminate interest from the economy by December 2027 marked a pivotal moment in Pakistan\u2019s financial landscape. The judgment declared an unequivocal prohibition of Riba (including banking interest) in all its manifestations and forms, setting a target to transform the nation into an interest-free economy by the end of 2027. This historic decision necessitates amendments to align all laws and regulations with the essence of this judgment.\n\nThe Federal Shariat Court (FSC) has further ruled that upcoming financial dealings involving Pakistan, be it financing or contracts with international financial bodies, should also adhere to Shariah-compliant financial methods, such as the issuance of Sukuk. This signifies a significant shift towards embracing Islamic finance principles in the country\u2019s financial engagements.\n\nIn Pakistan, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Islamic banking industry assets have crossed the benchmark of Rs8.1 trillion by June 2023 (approximately $29bn), while the overall Islamic finance industry is reaching close to the Rs10tr mark by adding the market share for the Islamic mutual funds, Sukuk, Modaraba, Islamic Real Estate Investment Trusts and Takaful sectors.\n\nAccording to SBP statistics, at the start of 2002, the Islamic banking industry assets were Rs 5.5tr while deposits were Rs4.2tr with over 5,350 branches. The FSC judgment has provided a positive growth impetus to the industry that grew by over Rs2.5tr in asset size and over Rs1.6tr in terms of deposits in just 18 months, reaching Rs8.1tr in total assets and deposits of over Rs5.8tr.\n\nPakistan is steadily moving towards Shariah compliance across all financial sectors\n\nThe Islamic banking branch network also expanded by 970 branches in just 18 months to make the overall network of Islamic banking branches close to 6,400. The positive growth is likely to continue, with more big banks now eyeing conversion to Islamic banking.\n\nThe growth numbers not only reflect the strength of the value proposition offered by Islamic banking and finance but also reflect the strong grassroots demand for Shariah-compliant financial services and wider acceptance of the conversion roadmap provided by the Shariat Court.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has also taken the front seat and is taking steps to convert the non-banking financial sector to Islamic principles. Post FSC judgment, the commission issued the Islamic Finance Diagnostic Report early at the start of 2023 and recently issued Guidelines for Offering Islamic Financial Service 2023, while the Islamic Finance department at SECP is working on several initiatives for conversion.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance is also actively working with State-Owned Entities (SOEs) towards formulating conversion strategies to transform their existing financial dealings into the realm of Islamic Finance. This transformative drive reflects a significant commitment to fostering Islamic Finance within the public sector, reshaping the financial landscape in Pakistan.\n\nThe central bank has also provided detailed guidelines and regulatory standards to facilitate conventional banks\u2019 desire to convert their operations as per Shariah principles. The SBP has also played a pivotal role in not only guiding but also facilitating the smooth transition of financial institutions into the Islamic finance realm.\n\nAn exemplary case in point is the remarkable conversion of Faysal Bank Limited to a complete Islamic bank by Dec 2022. This transformation is an unprecedented milestone in Pakistan\u2019s banking history, where a large conventional institution embraced Shariah-compliant principles.\n\nRecently, Summit Bank has announced a conversion to an Islamic bank, and according to news sources, a few other banks, including The Bank of Punjab, ZTBL, and a foreign bank operating in Pakistan, are also considering a complete shift towards becoming Islamic banks.\n\nThe FSC judgment effectively underscores various Sukuk types that the government can utilise in international capital markets to convert existing foreign currency debt and secure new international financing. This guidance is invaluable in facilitating these financial transactions.\n\nThe government has predominantly leaned on bank credit to meet its budgetary requirements, with investments in government securities comprising approximately 48 per cent of the banking sector\u2019s asset base as of the end of December 2022.\n\nA significant portion of these investments primarily involves conventional Market Treasury Bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds, which make up 87.3pc of the banks\u2019 overall holdings in government securities, while Sukuk constitute a relatively smaller share at 12.7pc.\n\nAfter the FSC judgment, the Pakistani government increased its focus on issuing Shariah-compliant Sukuk to replace its interest-based borrowing. In FY22, the government introduced a remarkable 23 Sukuks and successfully raised Rs1.34tr. Fast forward to 2023, in the last nine months, 24 new Sukuk were issued worth Rs1.07tr, taking the total sovereign Sukuk issuance to Rs5.051tr.\n\nThe impact of the FSC judgment and increased acceptance of Islamic finance can be witnessed at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), which now hosts two Islamic indices, namely the KMI-30 index and KMI-All Share Islamic Index to screen the listed companies in line with Shariah guidelines for investments in equities.\n\nThe market capitalisation of Shariah-compliant equities has reached 65pc of the overall market cap by June 2023, showing a positive shift in the corporate sector and increased acceptability of Islamic financial solutions.\n\nAccording to the SECP, the Islamic mutual fund industry is also witnessing robust growth. It has achieved an impressive 45pc market share, while the Shariah-compliant pension funds, targeting retail investors, command a majority market share of 65pc with assets under management of over Rs32 billion by June 30, 2023.\n\nIn conclusion, Pakistan\u2019s embrace of Islamic finance and its journey towards an interest-free economy, driven by the FSC\u2019s historic ruling, is not only reshaping the nation\u2019s financial landscape but also holds great promise for the future.\n\nMr Siddiqui is the Director at IBA\u2019s Centre for Excellence in Islamic Finance.\n\nEmail: aasiddiqui@iba.edu.pk.
