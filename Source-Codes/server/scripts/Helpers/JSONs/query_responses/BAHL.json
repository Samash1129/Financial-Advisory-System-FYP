            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

On the flip side, Mari Petroleum, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank, Habib Bank and Bank Alhabib Ltd lost value to weigh down on the index by 226 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 63,813.06 points after shedding 484.94 points or 0.75 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume further dipped by 10.39pc to 412.82 million shares.

            "text": "KARACHI: The arrival of the much-needed and long-awaited $1.1 billion tranche from the International Monetary Fund into the SBP accounts on Tuesday failed to boost investors\u2019 mood as the benchmark KSE 100 index yielded another gloomy performance.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the market extended its overnight bearish conditions, reacting to the central bank\u2019s maintaining a tight monetary stance due to still-high inflation, geopolitical risks and pending fiscal measures.\n\nHe added that the IMF\u2019s conditions for pursuing structural reforms in the energy sector and falling earnings in the oil, cement and auto sectors also contributed to the bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said selling pressure was observed during the latter part of the session as corporate result announcements showed a decline in earnings.\n\nPakistan Petroleum Ltd, Bank Al-Habib, Fauji Fertiliser, Millat Tractors, and Kot Addu Power made a significant positive contribution, cumulatively adding 134 points to the index.\n\nOn the other hand, Systems Ltd, United Bank Ltd, TRG Pakistan, Dawood Hercules, and Engro Fertilisers collectively lost 309 points.\n\nAs a result, the index hit an intraday record high of 72,119.66 and a low of 71,059.63. However, it closed at 71,102.55 points after losing 592.49 points, or 0.83pc, from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume fell 8.60pc to 560.55 million shares. The traded value also dipped 2.21pc to Rs25.73bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Worldcall Telecom (47.68m shares), Pace (Pak) Ltd (27.12m shares), Pak Petroleum (23.16m shares), Hascol Petroleum (22.72m shares) and Air Link Commun (22.16m shares).\n\nThe shares registering the most significant decre\u00adases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs90.02), Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs69.12), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (Rs41.06), Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs37.49) and Philip Morris (Pakistan) Ltd (Rs26.33).\n\nThe companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs446.29), Al-Abbas Sug\u00adar Mills Ltd (Rs43.53), Atlas Honda (Rs32.29), Pak Engi\u00adn\u00ade\u00adering Company (Rs20.00) and Pak Tobacco (Rs14.86).\n\nForeign investors made aggressive buying as their net purchases of shares soared to $2.96m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 1st, 2024",

            "text": "KARACHI: Conditionalities before the start of the final review with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and uncertainty about the possibility of a rate cut given the Ramazan-driven spike in inflation\n\nkept investors in a jittery mood as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed the outgoing week in the red.\n\nArif Habib Ltd (AHL) said the stock market remained under pressure throughout the outgoing week, primarily due to divided opinions about the upcoming monetary policy decision, alongside the government\u2019s negotiations with the IMF for final review.\n\nConcurrently, the formation of the cabinet and the appointment of Muhammad Aurangzeb as finance minister brought resolution to lingering uncertainties.\n\nAKD Securities Ltd said the additional conditionalities including expanding the tax net, removing specialised tax regimes, reviewing the NFC award, halting gas supply to power producers, and terminating gas subsidies for fertiliser plants all seem to be long-term goals that are put forward by the lender to possibly include in the budget 2024-25 budget.\n\nOn the economic front, according to AHL, the government raised Rs93bn against a target of Rs50bn through Ijarah sukuk, while broad money (M2) increased by Rs496bn to Rs32.7 trillion as of March 1. Additionally, the SBP reserves increased by $17 million to $7.9bn in the week ending on March 8. The rupee appreciated slightly against the US dollar at Rs278.74 gaining 29 paise or 0.11pc week-on-week.\n\nHence, the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed at 64,816 points, down by 977 points or 1.5pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise negative contributions came from fertiliser (215 points), oil & gas exploration (190 points), commercial banks (174 points), oil & gas marketing companies (103 points) and power (55 points). Meanwhile, the sectors which mainly contributed positively were automobile parts (20 points), paper & board (6 points) and chemicals (4 points).\n\nScrip-wise negative contributors were Dawood Hercules (203 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (108 points), Engro Corporation (78 points), Bank Al-Habib Ltd (68 points) and United Bank Ltd (68 points). On the flip side, scrip-wise positive contributions came from Meezan Bank Ltd (62 points), Engro Fertiliser (52 points), Lucky Cement (47 points), Thal Ltd (20 points), and Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (18 points).\n\nForeign buying continued during the outgoing week, clocking in at $2.7m compared to a net buy of $6.3m last week. Major buying was witnessed in commercial banks ($1.9m) and cement ($1.83m). On the local front, selling was reported by companies ($2.5m) followed by broker proprietary ($1.7m). Average volume dipped 20.1pc to 340m shares while the average value traded witnessed a steep fall of 30.5pc to $41m week-on-week.\n\nAHL said on the successful conclusion of the IMF review, Pakistan would receive the final tranche\n\nof $1.1bn under the current $3bn Stand-By Arrangement. Additionally, the energy minister has emphasised the importance of addressing the energy circular debt, with efforts to expedite its resolution underway any favourable progress in this regard would uplift market sentiment.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 17th, 2024",
