            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "The Federal Shariat Court ruling in April 2022 to eliminate interest from the economy by December 2027 marked a pivotal moment in Pakistan\u2019s financial landscape. The judgment declared an unequivocal prohibition of Riba (including banking interest) in all its manifestations and forms, setting a target to transform the nation into an interest-free economy by the end of 2027. This historic decision necessitates amendments to align all laws and regulations with the essence of this judgment.\n\nThe Federal Shariat Court (FSC) has further ruled that upcoming financial dealings involving Pakistan, be it financing or contracts with international financial bodies, should also adhere to Shariah-compliant financial methods, such as the issuance of Sukuk. This signifies a significant shift towards embracing Islamic finance principles in the country\u2019s financial engagements.\n\nIn Pakistan, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Islamic banking industry assets have crossed the benchmark of Rs8.1 trillion by June 2023 (approximately $29bn), while the overall Islamic finance industry is reaching close to the Rs10tr mark by adding the market share for the Islamic mutual funds, Sukuk, Modaraba, Islamic Real Estate Investment Trusts and Takaful sectors.\n\nAccording to SBP statistics, at the start of 2002, the Islamic banking industry assets were Rs 5.5tr while deposits were Rs4.2tr with over 5,350 branches. The FSC judgment has provided a positive growth impetus to the industry that grew by over Rs2.5tr in asset size and over Rs1.6tr in terms of deposits in just 18 months, reaching Rs8.1tr in total assets and deposits of over Rs5.8tr.\n\nPakistan is steadily moving towards Shariah compliance across all financial sectors\n\nThe Islamic banking branch network also expanded by 970 branches in just 18 months to make the overall network of Islamic banking branches close to 6,400. The positive growth is likely to continue, with more big banks now eyeing conversion to Islamic banking.\n\nThe growth numbers not only reflect the strength of the value proposition offered by Islamic banking and finance but also reflect the strong grassroots demand for Shariah-compliant financial services and wider acceptance of the conversion roadmap provided by the Shariat Court.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has also taken the front seat and is taking steps to convert the non-banking financial sector to Islamic principles. Post FSC judgment, the commission issued the Islamic Finance Diagnostic Report early at the start of 2023 and recently issued Guidelines for Offering Islamic Financial Service 2023, while the Islamic Finance department at SECP is working on several initiatives for conversion.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance is also actively working with State-Owned Entities (SOEs) towards formulating conversion strategies to transform their existing financial dealings into the realm of Islamic Finance. This transformative drive reflects a significant commitment to fostering Islamic Finance within the public sector, reshaping the financial landscape in Pakistan.\n\nThe central bank has also provided detailed guidelines and regulatory standards to facilitate conventional banks\u2019 desire to convert their operations as per Shariah principles. The SBP has also played a pivotal role in not only guiding but also facilitating the smooth transition of financial institutions into the Islamic finance realm.\n\nAn exemplary case in point is the remarkable conversion of Faysal Bank Limited to a complete Islamic bank by Dec 2022. This transformation is an unprecedented milestone in Pakistan\u2019s banking history, where a large conventional institution embraced Shariah-compliant principles.\n\nRecently, Summit Bank has announced a conversion to an Islamic bank, and according to news sources, a few other banks, including The Bank of Punjab, ZTBL, and a foreign bank operating in Pakistan, are also considering a complete shift towards becoming Islamic banks.\n\nThe FSC judgment effectively underscores various Sukuk types that the government can utilise in international capital markets to convert existing foreign currency debt and secure new international financing. This guidance is invaluable in facilitating these financial transactions.\n\nThe government has predominantly leaned on bank credit to meet its budgetary requirements, with investments in government securities comprising approximately 48 per cent of the banking sector\u2019s asset base as of the end of December 2022.\n\nA significant portion of these investments primarily involves conventional Market Treasury Bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds, which make up 87.3pc of the banks\u2019 overall holdings in government securities, while Sukuk constitute a relatively smaller share at 12.7pc.\n\nAfter the FSC judgment, the Pakistani government increased its focus on issuing Shariah-compliant Sukuk to replace its interest-based borrowing. In FY22, the government introduced a remarkable 23 Sukuks and successfully raised Rs1.34tr. Fast forward to 2023, in the last nine months, 24 new Sukuk were issued worth Rs1.07tr, taking the total sovereign Sukuk issuance to Rs5.051tr.\n\nThe impact of the FSC judgment and increased acceptance of Islamic finance can be witnessed at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), which now hosts two Islamic indices, namely the KMI-30 index and KMI-All Share Islamic Index to screen the listed companies in line with Shariah guidelines for investments in equities.\n\nThe market capitalisation of Shariah-compliant equities has reached 65pc of the overall market cap by June 2023, showing a positive shift in the corporate sector and increased acceptability of Islamic financial solutions.\n\nAccording to the SECP, the Islamic mutual fund industry is also witnessing robust growth. It has achieved an impressive 45pc market share, while the Shariah-compliant pension funds, targeting retail investors, command a majority market share of 65pc with assets under management of over Rs32 billion by June 30, 2023.\n\nIn conclusion, Pakistan\u2019s embrace of Islamic finance and its journey towards an interest-free economy, driven by the FSC\u2019s historic ruling, is not only reshaping the nation\u2019s financial landscape but also holds great promise for the future.\n\nMr Siddiqui is the Director at IBA\u2019s Centre for Excellence in Islamic Finance.\n\nEmail: aasiddiqui@iba.edu.pk.

What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nBOK\u2019s initiative is a crucial component of a wider campaign by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) aimed at curbing illicit activities within the underground market.\n\nThe SBP has recently introduced structural reforms within the exchange company sector to enhance regulatory oversight, bolster governance frameworks, fortify internal controls, and tighten compliance protocols.\n\nFurthermore, the SBP has raised the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional stipulation that the capital must be unencumbered by prior losses.\n\nEarlier, major banks including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), Bank Alfalah (BAFL), Habib Metropolitan Bank, Askari Bank Limited and Bank of Punjab announced their plans to establish their own forex companies.\n\nThe SBP issued no-objection certificate (NOC) to ABL and MCB for establishing their exchange companies. Allied Bank\u2019s exchange company will be named ABL Exchange Company (Private) Limited and MCB\u2019s as MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

            "text": "The banking sector in Pakistan maintained robust growth in profitability during 2023, including growth in assets and deposits, the high-interest rate regime allowed them to make handsome margins, increase investment in securities, and lend cash to the federal government at exorbitant financing rates.\n\nOn the other hand, they attracted deposits from customers, providing them with handsome returns too. There have also been major transformations and developments in a few commercial banks, which will impact the banking sector positively in the long term.\n\nALSO READ Bank Alfalah Launches Pakistan\u2019s First Digital Payments Sales and Service Centers Focusing on Merchants and Small Businesses\n\nSome of the initiatives taken by different commercial banks will be followed by other competing banks in the near future. Below are a few major developments that happened during 2023:\n\n(1) Faysal Bank\u2019s Conversion to Islamic Bank\n\nFaysal Bank announced its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank on the first day of the calendar year. The bank converted its assets, deposits, operations, branches, and licenses from conventional to Sharia-based banks and became the second-biggest Islamic bank in the banking industry.\n\nThis transition is said to be the biggest conversion of any conventional bank, not only in Pakistan but in the world, considering the size of the operation. The transformation of Faysal Bank also provided a roadmap for other banks seeking to convert their operations from conventional to Islamic.\n\n(2) MCB Bank Acquires 81% Stake in Asset Management Company\n\nMCB Bank acquired an additional 30 percent stake in its subsidiary, MCBAH Savings and Investments, at the cost of Rs. 649 million. Through this deal, the bank received 21.6 million shares, or 30 percent, of another sponsor, Arif Habib Corporation, at a share price of Rs. 30. Hence, its overall shareholding in the subsidiary increased to over 81 percent from 51 percent.\n\nMCB-AH Limited is one of the leading asset management companies in the fund management sector, and a few companies within a sector are also listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The transition in shareholding will strengthen the position of the bank in the financial sector.\n\n(3) JS Bank Acquires Major Shareholding in BankIslami\n\nJS Bank Acquired major shares in BankIslami to convert the Islamic bank into its subsidiary with ownership of the significant shareholding. The bank increased its stakes in the Islamic bank by 75 percent by purchasing shares from the parent financial entity, JS Group.\n\nThe share swap deal was successful between the sponsors of the Islamic bank, despite being challenged in the Sindh High Court. JS Bank maintained a different strategic position, which will increase its profitability and influence in the banking industry after this deal.\n\n(4) Prominent Banks Plan for Conversion to Islamic Banking\n\nProminent conventional banks with a separate division of Islamic banking announced their plans for full-fledged conversion to Islamic Banking in light of a verdict issued by the Federal Shariat Court last year.\n\nThe banks included the Bank of Punjab, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, and Summit Bank. In this regard, the Bank of Punjab hired a consultant, and Summit Bank rebranded itself as Mukramah Bank. This transition in banking operations will likely attract different conventional banks to follow the same suit.\n\nALSO READ Financial Irregularities Worth Rs.14 Billion Allegedly Uncovered During PSL Audit\n\n(5) Bank Alfalah Acquires Stakes in QistBazaar\n\nBank Alfalah acquired 7.2 percent stakes in BNPL QistBazaar at a cost of Rs. 140 million. The deal can be a win-win situation for both entities in scaling up their business and profitability.\n\nIn addition to the equity agreement, Bank Alfalah, and QistBazaar signed an embedded financing agreement in Shariah-compliant mode for up to Rs. 350 million. Accordingly, the bank will incorporate digital financing products within the QistBazaar platform to offer embedded consumer durables financing in BNPL\u2019s mode.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s move to invest in QistBazaar can prove a stepping stone to strengthening the fintech landscape of the country, as more banks are likely to follow suit for collaboration and investment in fintech companies, which is the need of the hour.\n\n(6) Major Banks to Set up Exchange Companies\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) plans to streamline the business of foreign exchange across the country with control and regulation on trade and flows of foreign currencies, mainly to monitor the stability of the rupee against the dollar. In this regard, the banking industry watched as various exchange companies in Category B shut down while commercial banks were allowed to establish their foreign exchange subsidiaries as an alternate option in the financial sector.\n\nAn overwhelming number of banks made announcements to set up subsidiaries of foreign exchange, including HBL, UBL, MCB, Bank Al Habib, Meezan Bank, Habib Metro Bank, Askari Bank, etc.\n\n(7) Summit Bank Receives Investment from UAE\n\nSummit Bank received a significant capital injection of Rs. 10 billion from its sponsor and prominent UAE investor, Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah.\n\nThe investor subscribed to 3.98 billion new shares of the bank at Rs. 2.51 per share, becoming the major shareholder in the bank. Moreover, Summit Bank plans to convert its entire operation from a conventional banking system to an Islamic one, similar to Faysal Bank. Its board of directors also approved a three-year conversion plan, and the bank has been renamed Bank Makramah Limited\n\n(8) Silk Bank Attracts Investors\n\nSilk Bank, once again, sought the financial support of a strong investor on a long-term basis to fulfill its regulatory requirements of paid-up capital and the sustainability of its profitable operations.\n\nThe bank has attracted interest from MCB Bank, United Bank Limited, International Commercial Bank of South Sudan, and Pakistan Housing Finance Company for investment and merger. At present, these financial institutions are carrying out the due diligence of the bank, which is showing the increasing competition among these entities in striking a deal with Silk Bank.\n\nSudanese Bank and Pakistan Housing Company even expressed their investment plans of 50 million euros and Rs. 12 billion, respectively. With four proposals in hand, it is a good time for Silk Bank to say yes to at least one institution with remarkable experience in local industry and operating a subsidiary.\n\nALSO READ State Bank Fails to Satisfy Panel in Rs. 70 Billion Money Laundering Scandal\n\n(9) Meezan Bank Collaborates to Launch Islamic Microfinance Services\n\nMeezan Bank took the initiative to collaborate with SAFCO Microfinance Company Private Limited (SMCL) for the launch of Islamic microfinance services in the low-income segment of society.\n\nThis is the first time that a commercial bank has significantly supported a microfinance institution. The leading Islamic bank has committed to providing Rs. 100 million in financing and technical support for product development, capacity building, and training for the microfinance company.\n\nThe step will further accelerate the penetration of Islamic banking across the country. The microfinance company established its inaugural Islamic microfinance branch under the brand name \u2018Yaqeen\u2019 in Hyderabad, Pakistan.\n\n(10) HBL to Set Up a Specialized Agri Subsidiary\n\nHabib Bank Limited received approval from the State Bank of Pakistan to set up a specialized subsidiary for the agriculture sector. The subsidiary will work to provide financial access to farmers and other players in the agriculture sector, particularly, but the institution has plans to be deeply involved in the sector\u2019s development.\n\nThe leading bank previously carried out different projects successfully in this sector, which gave it the confidence to enhance its footprints in the food sector with a much bigger role and a long-term profitable engagement. The out-of-box approach of the bank\u2019s leadership might give it a competitive edge in the industry.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Extending the overnight losses, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) remained under selling pressure dragging the benchmark KSE 100-share index below the 67,000 level on Monday.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said a slowdown in GDP growth to 1pc in the second quarter of the current fiscal year compared to 2.2pc in the same period last year worried investors who resorted to taking profits at the current levels.\n\nHe said that the widening of the trade deficit by 56.3pc year-on-year to $2.171bn in March, speculations about the outcome of Pakistan-IMF talks on April 14, and investor concerns about surging industrial power tariffs further fuelled the market downtrend.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said throughout the session, the index displayed a mixed performance, hitting intraday highs and lows at 67,304 and 66,741 points, respectively.\n\nOil & gas, IT, textile and cement sectors contributed negatively to the index\u2019s movement as Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd, Systems Ltd, PTCL, Lucky Cement and Interloop Ltd collectively wiped out 133 points.\n\nHowever, Hub Power Company, Meezan Bank Ltd and Faysal Bank Ltd contributed positively, adding 67 points to the index.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 66,796.32 points after losing 208.79 points, or 0.31 per cent, from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume dipped 23.70pc to 238.82.03 million shares. The traded value also fell by 15.49pc to Rs8.36bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (39.96m shares), Agritech Ltd (31.10m shares), Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (21.23m shares), Pak Reinsurance Ltd (15.08m shares) and WorldCall Telecom Ltd (13.09m shares).\n\nThe shares registering the most significant inc\u00adreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Prod\u00aducts Company Ltd (Rs75.00), Hallmark Com\u00adpany Ltd (Rs34.42), Shah\u00admurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs31.47), Sazgar Engi\u00adneering Company Ltd (Rs26.79) and Al-Abbas Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs20.00).\n\nThe companies registering the major decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs95.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs19.48), Service Indus\u00adtries Ltd (Rs14.99), Pac\u00adkages Ltd (Rs14.98) and Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs11.92).\n\nForeign investors turned net buyers as they purchased shares worth $0.04m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 2nd, 2024",

            "text": "KARACHI: Pakistan\u2019s first fully conventional to Islamic converted bank, Faysal Bank Limited (FBL) has planned to expand its branch network up to 1,000 branches and strengthen its operations through technology upgradation and introducing best Islamic banking products.\n\nTalking to Business Recorder Mian Mohammad Younis, Chairman of the Board of FBL- the second largest Islamic bank in Pakistan briefed about the Faysal Bank\u2019s journey from conventional to Islamic Bank and Bank\u2019s future plan to capture the market share of Islamic banking industry in Pakistan.\n\nHe informed that the steps that are being taken after having an Islamic Banking license effective 1st Jan 2023, to align with BoD\u2019s vision, direction and dedication is to prepare a strategic plan of growth from 2023-2028.\n\n\u201cUnder this plan, FBL has decided to expand the branch network up to 1,000 branches from 700 and penetrate not only major cities but also unbanked or rural areas to enhance financial inclusion\u201d, he added.\n\nMian Mohammad Younis, appointed in July this year as Chairman BoD FBL, has over four decades of financial expertise holding positions in different Government, and Autonomous Bodies such as FBR, Economic Affairs Division, Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Board of Investment and Pakistan Software Export Board, Finance Division.\n\nReplying to a question on international operation, Younis said that at this stage priority is to further strengthen its footing in Pakistan by expanding the branch network and introducing new Islamic financing products.\n\n\u201cCurrently we are focusing on further expanding, consolidating and strengthening operations in Pakistan as there is a massive scope of Islamic Banking in the country. However, we seek comfort in our affiliation with the Ithmaar Bank Bahrain which gives international exposure and is highly beneficial,\u201d he added.\n\nHe added that the most difficult area of Islamic way of Financing is the Agriculture Sector, as specialized and specific Islamic products are required to be introduced which Faysal Bank has already done and is also in the process of developing more Islamic products with technological resources.\n\nHe said that a complete conversion from conventional to Islamic was a very big and difficult decision but the entire management and staff makes it a success story for other financial institutions.\n\nNow other conventional banks can take full advantage of FBL\u2019s journey to become a fully-fledged Islamic bank. Now with the documented conversion of Faysal Bank as the finest roadmap, it is strongly equipped to support the conversion of other banks, he added.\u201cOn behalf of FBL we will welcome all other financial institutions and are pleased to extend expertise wherever they need facilitation in the conversion process,\u201d he said.\n\nWhile Faysal Bank\u2019s conversion was planned, the Shariah Board and Shariah Compliance Department was set up for acquisition and it allowed the gradual conversion of already existing branches as well as launching of new Islamic Branches. Accordingly, some 90 branches were converted by 2021 and entire banks successfully converted by January 1, 2023.\n\n\u201cThe Senior Management, Shariah Scholars, and our employees each played their active role in facilitating us on this journey. We didn\u2019t close the banking operations for a single day, trained the staff, and not only retained all our customers but grew by leaps and bounds,\u201d he added.\n\nYounis said that as a regulator the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has played a very positive role and not only extended its full support but also encouraged conversion.\n\nSimultaneous development of innovative Islamic products such as Modaraba, Musharakah, Istisna, etc, as advised by Shariah Board scholars, covered all aspects of financing, and helped the teams make headway in appeasing customers and expanding operations, Chairman BoD FBL said.\n\n\u201cWe make sure to derive modern technological convenience in all our products and presently at Faysal Bank, we have the largest cluster of products within the Islamic Banking industry,\u201d he maintained. He mentioned that FBL is among those, which have been requested by the SBP to set up an exchange company. As per the direction of the regulator, Faysal Bank has planned to establish its own Foreign Exchange Company subject to BoD and regulatory approvals.\n\nHe said that FBL has invested heavily in digitalization to ensure the expansion of our outreach and maximum inclusivity. The 21st century is all about instant access and ease of services, therefore our focus will be on enhancing the Faysal App and offering maximum digital products to our customers, he added.\n\nThe last quarter of 2022 saw, Islamic banking shares at 20.3 percent of banking sector assets with 22 percent of deposits. SBP\u2019s target for the Islamic banking sector is to contribute over 30 percent to the overall banking industry assets and deposits, by 2025 and the Faysal Bank is making efforts to meet the SBP\u2019s target, he said.\n\nThe FBL has also proved that with dedication, conversion is achievable with a strong positive impact, if well planned, he concluded.\n\nThe current year is the inaugural year as an Islamic Bank and the FBL achieved remarkable financial performance and unprecedented growth. Despite the challenges, FBL achieved a record Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs 15.1 billion during the first half of CY23, marking a remarkable 73.6 percent higher than Rs 6.4 billion in the corresponding period last year.\n\nProfit After Tax (PAT) rose to Rs 7.5 billion in H1\u201923 representing a 71.7 percent increase from Rs 4.4 billion in December 2022.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2023",

            "text": "KARACHI: Share prices of Islamic banks took a beating on Monday, thanks to Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar\u2019s recent statement that customers are getting short-changed by Sharia-compliant lenders by way of insufficient returns on deposits.\n\nSpeaking to a TV host, Dr Akhtar said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) should review the issue of minimum deposit rate (MDR) \u2014 a provision that Islamic banks are currently exempted from.\n\nWith every new finance minister in Islamabad comes a fresh wave of measures aimed at shifting money from the bottom lines of banks to the national exchequer. But for the first time in many years, there\u2019s a proposal on the cards that, if adopted, will transfer money from (Islamic) banks to customers.\n\nBack in 2008 when the current finance minister held the position of SBP governor, the regulator directed banks, including Islamic ones, to pay minimum profit rates on savings accounts. Even though Islamic banks were exempted from the provision in subsequent years, conventional banks are still required to pay a certain rate on all savings accounts.\n\nThe MDR is 150 basis points less than the prevailing benchmark interest rate. In other words, every conventional bank is bound to pay an interest rate of 20.5 per cent to its savings account holders as long as the key interest rate remains 22pc.\n\nAccording to Arif Habib Ltd analyst Sana Tawfik, Islamic banks have been exempted from this requirement to promote Sharia-compliant banking in the country.\n\nAmong the three full-fledged Islamic banks listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), the proportion of savings deposits in their total deposits stood at 40pc for Meezan Bank Ltd, 42pc for Faysal Bank Ltd and 25pc for BankIslami Pakistan Ltd at the end of the September quarter, according to Ms Tawfik.\n\nA sensitivity analysis conducted by her brokerage showed that a 1pc increase in the cost of savings deposits will reduce the earnings per share of Meezan Bank Ltd by Rs2.27, Faysal Bank Ltd by Rs1.35 and BankIslami Pakistan Ltd by Rs0.53.\n\nA research report written by JS Global Head of Research Amreen Soorani stated that Islamic banks are currently offering savings rates that are between seven and 9.5 percentage points lower than the MDR offered by conventional banks.\n\n\u201cThe recent sharp rise in interest rates has widened the said spread, which used to range between 300-500 basis points previously,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, a lender like Meezan Bank Ltd with an outsize market share within the Islamic banking industry is expected to successfully counter the negative impact of the MDR for a host of reasons, she said.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019ll be able to mobilise higher deposits by offering the same returns that are being offered by its conventional peers. \u201cThis would likely boost the volumetric growth of the bank\u2019s deposit base,\u201d she said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 28th, 2023",

            "text": "For a common man, figuring out how to manage and invest money in Pakistan is sometimes like finding your way through a maze. There are different ways to handle money, like keeping it with conventional banks, buying mutual funds units or stock, holding on to gold or property, investing funds, or opening an account with an Islamic bank that follows Sharia principles.\n\nAccording to the 2021 World Bank\u2019s Global Index, a mere 21 per cent of adults in Pakistan have robust access to financial services, significantly below the global average of 69pc. The gender gap intensifies this issue, with only 13pc of women holding bank accounts, ranking Pakistan as the fourth-lowest globally for female banking. The State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) gender finance policy aims to increase the percentage of female customers to 30pc by 2025.\n\nAs per the SBP website, out of Pakistan\u2019s total adult population, the financially excluded population makes up 53pc. The situation for Pakistan is also unique as it includes a voluntary unbanked segment.\n\nThe main reasons behind this trend include a lack of financial literacy as well as a deep-rooted religious belief about the impermissibility of interest-based dealings, including banking. The issue worsens if the right choices are not made available for savings and investment. Consequently, a common man may fall prey to the traps of shady investment companies or Ponzi schemes, enticing unaware customers to trust them with their hard-earned money to avoid interest.\n\nAn SBP study states that 94.5pc of the respondents with banking experience believe that interest is prohibited\n\nThe Knowledge, Attitudes and Practices of Islamic Banking in Pakistan study conducted by the State Bank of Pakistan states that 94.5pc of the respondents with banking experience acknowledge that Riba (interest) is prohibited and 88.4pc of respondents further acknowledge that conventional banking profits are based on Riba. Moreover, this ratio sours to 98pc in the unbanked segment of society where the masses believe Riba is prohibited.\n\nThe social stigma associated with interest in Pakistani society complicates discussions around financial practices. A recent study in a finance journal highlights that people may not openly admit their use of conventional interest-based financial services due to this social taboo.\n\nPolicymakers need to ensure that everyone, irrespective of gender, age, wealth, or religious beliefs, has access to viable financial services. This is especially important in a country like Pakistan, where a significant portion of the population lacks basic education, let alone knowledge about finances. For them, using banks may seem problematic due to concerns about potential conflicts with religious values.\n\nLuckily, we have seen positive steps taken by the State Bank of Pakistan over the last two decades. The emergence of licensed Islamic commercial banks, separate Islamic banking regulations, and supervision mechanisms from early 2002 has provided a viable alternative to those who are faith-sensitive and avoid interest.\n\nToday in Pakistan, we have six full-fledged Islamic banks and 16 Islamic banking windows with over 6,550 branches offering Sharia-compliant products and services to customers. Faysal Bank\u2019s recent successful conversion to completely Islamic banking has given much-needed encouragement to other banks, and at least three banks are now eyeing complete conversion, confirming the demand at the grassroots level for Sharia-compliant banking.\n\nAccording to the latest SBP Islamic banking bulletin data, the Islamic banking market share has reached 26pc of the total financing and 22.5pc of the total industry deposits. The assets of the Islamic banking industry have crossed Rs 8.4 trillion, while investments have grown to Rs3.9tr.\n\nThe growth of Islamic banking is making it easier for individuals who were away from banks for religious reasons to be confident that their savings can adhere to Islamic principles and can be invested to earn suitable returns.\n\nBy further supporting this growth, the country can boost the savings rates, which are much needed to support economic activities. When idle money moves to formal banking instead of staying at home, it will help the overall wealth and benefit everyone in society.\n\nOn the non-banking front, the Securities And Exchange Commission, the apex regulator for Pakistan\u2019s non-banking and finance sector, has taken a proactive approach to support Islamic finance in recent years.\n\nThis has resulted in several noteworthy accomplishments, including the development of the Takaful sector, growth in Islamic mutual funds, increased offering of listed and privately placed and very recently supporting the launch of the first sovereign Sukuk at Pakistan Stock Exchage. These steps will provide more avenues for faith-based investors and more options for the market.\n\nIslamic finance follows the rules based on Sharia principles, which means it focuses on doing morally right things, avoiding transactions involving interest, promote real economic transactions linked to real assets or business activities.\n\nIslamic finance also encourages the sharing of risks and rewards and promotes real trade activities while avoiding speculation and artificial financial deals like conventional derivatives, options, swaps, and futures.\n\nAdditionally, the social aspect of Islamic finance promotes a strong sense of social responsibility, where people contribute to charities (through Zakat) and are encouraged to give voluntary donations to help others and promote social well-being.\n\nAhmed Ali Siddiqui is the Director of IBA Centre for Excellence in Islamic Finance and Ahmar Aleem is a lecturer at NED University and a research fellow at Meezan Bank\n\nPublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, January 29th, 2024",
