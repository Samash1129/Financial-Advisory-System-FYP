            "text": "Faysal Bank declared a consolidated profit after tax (PAT) of Rs20.25 billion for the year 2023, nearly 77% higher than the Rs11.44 billion recorded in 2022.\n\nAs per the financial results provided to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday, Faysal Bank announced earnings per share (EPS) of Rs13.34, as compared to EPS of Rs7.54 in same period last year.\n\nIn addition, the Board of Directors of Faysal Bank Limited announced a final cash dividend of Rs2 per share i.e. 20%. This is in addition to a 10% interim cash dividend for the second quarter and a 10% interim cash dividend for the third quarter.\n\nFaysal Bank\u2019s profit surges 76% in 6MCY23\n\nThe increase in profit was led by a sharp spike in profit/return earned on Islamic financing and related assets, investments and placements.\n\n\u201cThis unprecedented profitability was mainly fueled by surge in profit earned spurred by a 600bps hike in interest rates during the year,\u201d said Arif Habib Limited (AHL) in a note.\n\nThe net profit/return rose from Rs39.99 billion in 2022 to Rs71.07 billion in 2023, an increase of nearly 78%.\n\nAmong other income, the fee and commission income earned by Faysal Bank in 2023 clocked in at Rs9.4 billion, a surge of over 25% against Rs7.5 billion earned in the same period last year.\n\nHowever, the dividend income of the firm reduced 36% from Rs513.46 million in 2022 to Rs327.23 million in 2023.\n\nFaysal Bank\u2019s foreign exchange income registered exceptional growth of nearly 84% from Rs2.6 billion in 2022 to Rs4.8 billion in 2023.\n\nThe other income earned by the bank remained largely stable at Rs263.6 million in 2023 as compared to Rs225.9 million in SPLY.\n\nDuring 2023, operating expenses of Faysal Bank amounted to Rs40.25 billion, up 47% against Rs27.37 billion in SPLY.\n\nFaysal Bank reported a sharp hike in expenditure on worker welfare fund, which almost doubled during the period.

            "text": "KARACHI: Bears maintained a firm grip on the Pakistan Stock Exchange for the third consecutive session on Thursday, dragging the benchmark KSE 100 share index below the 71,000 level amid persisting gloomy conditions.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said unabated institutional profit-taking continued to fuel bearish sentiments after a slump in global crude oil prices and dismal external trade data.\n\nExports fell 9pc month-on-month to $2.35bn in April, while the trade deficit more than doubled to $2.374bn from $846m in the same month last year.\n\nHe added that uncertainty about talks with the International Monetary Fund for a new $8bn Extended Fund Facility, weak earnings outlook amid surging energy prices and reports of disagreement among coalition partners on the privatisation policy contributed to a bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said sectors such as technology and fertiliser contributed to the index\u2019s decline, with TRG Pakistan, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Engro Fertilisers, Engro Corpo\u00adration and Systems Ltd collectively wiping out 248 points. Conversely, Bank Alfalah Ltd, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, and Interloop Ltd added 103 points.\n\nAs a result, the index hit an intraday high of 71,292.83 and a low of 70,562.12. However, it closed at 70,657.64 points after shedding 444.91 points, or 0.63pc, from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume dipped 22.04pc to 436.99 million shares. The traded value also fell 26.06pc to Rs19.02bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included K-Electric (30.10m shares), Worldcall Telecom (25.12m shares), The Bank of Punjab (20.16m shares), Pakistan Inter\u00adnational Airlines (15.72m shares) and Faysal Bank Ltd (14.05m shares).\n\nThe shares registering the most significant decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakitan Foods Ltd (Rs717.85), Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs86.15), Sapphire Textile Ltd (Rs34.90), Mari Petroleum (Rs31.65) and Pak Tobacco (Rs23.79).\n\nThe companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Sapphire Fibres (Rs56.42), Khyber Tobacco (Rs20.25), Atlas Honda (Rs16.72), Ghand\u00adhara Ind (Rs15.86) and Bolan Castings (Rs9.48).\n\nForeign investors continued aggressive buying as their net purchases of shares stood at $2.85m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, May 3rd, 2024",

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "short_description": "Here's What Happened in Pakistan's Banking Sector in 2023  ProPakistani",
            "text": "The banking sector in Pakistan maintained robust growth in profitability during 2023, including growth in assets and deposits, the high-interest rate regime allowed them to make handsome margins, increase investment in securities, and lend cash to the federal government at exorbitant financing rates.\n\nOn the other hand, they attracted deposits from customers, providing them with handsome returns too. There have also been major transformations and developments in a few commercial banks, which will impact the banking sector positively in the long term.\n\nALSO READ Bank Alfalah Launches Pakistan\u2019s First Digital Payments Sales and Service Centers Focusing on Merchants and Small Businesses\n\nSome of the initiatives taken by different commercial banks will be followed by other competing banks in the near future. Below are a few major developments that happened during 2023:\n\n(1) Faysal Bank\u2019s Conversion to Islamic Bank\n\nFaysal Bank announced its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank on the first day of the calendar year. The bank converted its assets, deposits, operations, branches, and licenses from conventional to Sharia-based banks and became the second-biggest Islamic bank in the banking industry.\n\nThis transition is said to be the biggest conversion of any conventional bank, not only in Pakistan but in the world, considering the size of the operation. The transformation of Faysal Bank also provided a roadmap for other banks seeking to convert their operations from conventional to Islamic.\n\n(2) MCB Bank Acquires 81% Stake in Asset Management Company\n\nMCB Bank acquired an additional 30 percent stake in its subsidiary, MCBAH Savings and Investments, at the cost of Rs. 649 million. Through this deal, the bank received 21.6 million shares, or 30 percent, of another sponsor, Arif Habib Corporation, at a share price of Rs. 30. Hence, its overall shareholding in the subsidiary increased to over 81 percent from 51 percent.\n\nMCB-AH Limited is one of the leading asset management companies in the fund management sector, and a few companies within a sector are also listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The transition in shareholding will strengthen the position of the bank in the financial sector.\n\n(3) JS Bank Acquires Major Shareholding in BankIslami\n\nJS Bank Acquired major shares in BankIslami to convert the Islamic bank into its subsidiary with ownership of the significant shareholding. The bank increased its stakes in the Islamic bank by 75 percent by purchasing shares from the parent financial entity, JS Group.\n\nThe share swap deal was successful between the sponsors of the Islamic bank, despite being challenged in the Sindh High Court. JS Bank maintained a different strategic position, which will increase its profitability and influence in the banking industry after this deal.\n\n(4) Prominent Banks Plan for Conversion to Islamic Banking\n\nProminent conventional banks with a separate division of Islamic banking announced their plans for full-fledged conversion to Islamic Banking in light of a verdict issued by the Federal Shariat Court last year.\n\nThe banks included the Bank of Punjab, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, and Summit Bank. In this regard, the Bank of Punjab hired a consultant, and Summit Bank rebranded itself as Mukramah Bank. This transition in banking operations will likely attract different conventional banks to follow the same suit.\n\nALSO READ Financial Irregularities Worth Rs.14 Billion Allegedly Uncovered During PSL Audit\n\n(5) Bank Alfalah Acquires Stakes in QistBazaar\n\nBank Alfalah acquired 7.2 percent stakes in BNPL QistBazaar at a cost of Rs. 140 million. The deal can be a win-win situation for both entities in scaling up their business and profitability.\n\nIn addition to the equity agreement, Bank Alfalah, and QistBazaar signed an embedded financing agreement in Shariah-compliant mode for up to Rs. 350 million. Accordingly, the bank will incorporate digital financing products within the QistBazaar platform to offer embedded consumer durables financing in BNPL\u2019s mode.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s move to invest in QistBazaar can prove a stepping stone to strengthening the fintech landscape of the country, as more banks are likely to follow suit for collaboration and investment in fintech companies, which is the need of the hour.\n\n(6) Major Banks to Set up Exchange Companies\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) plans to streamline the business of foreign exchange across the country with control and regulation on trade and flows of foreign currencies, mainly to monitor the stability of the rupee against the dollar. In this regard, the banking industry watched as various exchange companies in Category B shut down while commercial banks were allowed to establish their foreign exchange subsidiaries as an alternate option in the financial sector.\n\nAn overwhelming number of banks made announcements to set up subsidiaries of foreign exchange, including HBL, UBL, MCB, Bank Al Habib, Meezan Bank, Habib Metro Bank, Askari Bank, etc.\n\n(7) Summit Bank Receives Investment from UAE\n\nSummit Bank received a significant capital injection of Rs. 10 billion from its sponsor and prominent UAE investor, Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah.\n\nThe investor subscribed to 3.98 billion new shares of the bank at Rs. 2.51 per share, becoming the major shareholder in the bank. Moreover, Summit Bank plans to convert its entire operation from a conventional banking system to an Islamic one, similar to Faysal Bank. Its board of directors also approved a three-year conversion plan, and the bank has been renamed Bank Makramah Limited\n\n(8) Silk Bank Attracts Investors\n\nSilk Bank, once again, sought the financial support of a strong investor on a long-term basis to fulfill its regulatory requirements of paid-up capital and the sustainability of its profitable operations.\n\nThe bank has attracted interest from MCB Bank, United Bank Limited, International Commercial Bank of South Sudan, and Pakistan Housing Finance Company for investment and merger. At present, these financial institutions are carrying out the due diligence of the bank, which is showing the increasing competition among these entities in striking a deal with Silk Bank.\n\nSudanese Bank and Pakistan Housing Company even expressed their investment plans of 50 million euros and Rs. 12 billion, respectively. With four proposals in hand, it is a good time for Silk Bank to say yes to at least one institution with remarkable experience in local industry and operating a subsidiary.\n\nALSO READ State Bank Fails to Satisfy Panel in Rs. 70 Billion Money Laundering Scandal\n\n(9) Meezan Bank Collaborates to Launch Islamic Microfinance Services\n\nMeezan Bank took the initiative to collaborate with SAFCO Microfinance Company Private Limited (SMCL) for the launch of Islamic microfinance services in the low-income segment of society.\n\nThis is the first time that a commercial bank has significantly supported a microfinance institution. The leading Islamic bank has committed to providing Rs. 100 million in financing and technical support for product development, capacity building, and training for the microfinance company.\n\nThe step will further accelerate the penetration of Islamic banking across the country. The microfinance company established its inaugural Islamic microfinance branch under the brand name \u2018Yaqeen\u2019 in Hyderabad, Pakistan.\n\n(10) HBL to Set Up a Specialized Agri Subsidiary\n\nHabib Bank Limited received approval from the State Bank of Pakistan to set up a specialized subsidiary for the agriculture sector. The subsidiary will work to provide financial access to farmers and other players in the agriculture sector, particularly, but the institution has plans to be deeply involved in the sector\u2019s development.\n\nThe leading bank previously carried out different projects successfully in this sector, which gave it the confidence to enhance its footprints in the food sector with a much bigger role and a long-term profitable engagement. The out-of-box approach of the bank\u2019s leadership might give it a competitive edge in the industry.",

The traded value also fell by 15.49pc to Rs8.36bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (39.96m shares), Agritech Ltd (31.10m shares), Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (21.23m shares), Pak Reinsurance Ltd (15.08m shares) and WorldCall Telecom Ltd (13.09m shares).\n\nThe shares registering the most significant inc\u00adreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Prod\u00aducts Company Ltd (Rs75.00), Hallmark Com\u00adpany Ltd (Rs34.42), Shah\u00admurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs31.47), Sazgar Engi\u00adneering Company Ltd (Rs26.79) and Al-Abbas Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs20.00).\n\nThe companies registering the major decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs95.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs19.48), Service Indus\u00adtries Ltd (Rs14.99), Pac\u00adkages Ltd (Rs14.98) and Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs11.92).\n\nForeign investors turned net buyers as they purchased shares worth $0.04m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 2nd, 2024",

The KSE-30 index decreased by 160.58 points or 0.69 percent to 23,234.08 points.\n\nAnalysts cited a decline in global crude oil prices and a 9 percent year-over-year drop in exports in April as major factors contributing to the market's bearish trend.\"Stocks closed lower amid institutional profit-taking after a slump in global crude oil prices and dismal data on exports,\" said Ahsan Mehanti, an analyst at Arif Habib Corp.\n\nThe market's decline was also attributed to uncertainty over Pakistan's talks with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a new $8 billion loan and a weak earnings outlook amid surging energy prices.\n\nTraded shares decreased by 124 million shares to 436.993 million shares from 560.552 million shares. The trading value dropped to Rs19.024 billion from Rs25.730 billion. Market capital lowered to Rs9.657 trillion against Rs9.746 trillion. Of 365 companies active in the session, 103 closed in green, 234 in red and 28 remained unchanged.\n\nSectors such as technology and fertilizer contributed to the index's decline, with companies TRG, FFC, EFERT, ENGRO, and SYS collectively losing 248 points. Conversely, BAFL, PPL, and ILP made positive contributions, adding a total of 103 points.\n\nThe highest increase was recorded in Sapphire Fibres Limited shares, which rose by Rs56.42 to Rs1,479.75 per share, followed by Khyber Tobacco Company Limited, which increased by Rs20.25 to Rs290.29 per share. A significant decline was noted in Unilever Pakistan Foods Limited, which fell by Rs717.85 to Rs19,282.15 per share, followed by Hallmark Company Limited, which closed lower by Rs86.15 to Rs1,062.97 per share.\n\nBrokerage Arif Habib Ltd said equities witnessed additional downside as stocks continued their decline, now falling more than 3.7 percent from the peak recorded in April.\n\nThe April Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a slowdown, registering at +17.34 percent for the fourth consecutive month. This trend has further pushed real interest rates up, providing the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) with room to initiate rate cuts starting from June.\n\nCement stocks rallied following the release of CPI numbers, with DGKC (+2.76 percent), FCCL (+2.86 percent), and MLCF (+1.02 percent) leading the gains. This trend is expected to continue as the probability of rate cuts increases.\n\nThe recent declines have positioned the benchmark index in a support zone around the 70,000 points level, from where a potential reversal can be expected. Moves above 71,200 would indicate a shift back to the upside for the market.\n\nK-Electric Ltd. remained the volume leader with 30.103 million shares which closed lower by 21 paisas to Rs4.26 per share. WorldCall Telecom followed it with 25.120 million shares, which closed lower by 2 paisas to Rs1.26 per share.\n\nOther significant turnover stocks included Bank of Punjab, PIAC (A), Faysal Bank, Pak Elektron, Air Link Commun, The Organic Meat, National Bank XD and Loads Limited. In Future Market, 322 companies recorded trading, of which 86 increased, 227 decreased and 9 remained unchanged.",

            "text": "KARACHI: After scaling a historic peak the previous day, the stock market on Thursday came under selling pressure as investors indulged in profit-taking, dragging the index below the 72,000 level.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said institutional profit-taking in selected overbought scrips and adjustments in the earning season stalled the overnight rally.\n\nHe added that the weak rupee and structural reforms for the new IMF programme are likely to withdraw subsidies in the energy, fertiliser, and gas sectors, and expectations over the status quo in the SBP policy announcement next week depressed market sentiments.\n\nAccording to Topline Securities Ltd, sectors such as oil and gas exploration, auto, banking, cement, and fertiliser contributed to the index\u2019s decline, with companies like Millat Tractors Ltd, Pakistan Oilfield Ltd, Lucky Cement, Faysal Bank Ltd, and Engro Corporation wiped out 206 points.\n\nConversely, United Bank Ltd, Oil and Gas Development Company, and Engro Fertilisers collectively contributed 167 points.\n\nAs a result, the index hit an intraday high of 72,593.25, with a 541.36-point gain and a low of 71,700.54, shedding 351.36 points. However, it closed at 71,971.40 points after losing 80.49 points, or 0.11pc, from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume surged 33.22pc to 798.52 million shares. The traded value also rose 12.60pc to Rs27.54bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included K-Electric Ltd (119.64m shares), WorldCall Telecom (79.95m shares), Unity Foods Ltd (44.27m shares), Pak International Bulk Terminal (33.57m shares) and Fauji Foods Ltd (30.12m shares).\n\nThe companies registering the major increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs74.31), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (Rs28.33), Honda Atlas Cars (Pakistan) Ltd (Rs20.92), Abbott Laboratories Ltd (Rs19.81) and Thal Ltd Rs18.20.\n\nThe shares registering the most significant decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs372.99), Sapphire Textile Mills Ltd (Rs79.34), Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs65.42), Bata Pakistan (Rs51.62) and Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs51.47).\n\nForeign investors turned net buyers as they picked shares worth $0.40m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 26th, 2024",

            "text": "Stock brokers watch share prices during a trading session at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) in the Provincial Capital on February 13, 2024. \u2014 Online\n\nStocks closed lower on Wednesday as investors opted for profit-taking amid dismal Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) data, traders said.\n\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) benchmark KSE 100-share Index fell by 150.34 points or 0.21 percent to close at 70,333.32 points. The highest index of the day remained at 70,725.50 points while the lowest level was recorded at 70,037.28 points. The KSE-30 index decreased by 81.97 points or 0.35 percent to 23,120.59 points.\n\n\u201cStocks closed lower as investors weigh dismal LSM data on negative growth 0.51 percent year-on-year for July-Feb\u201923, IMF higher inflation projections at 24.8 percent and subdued economic growth at 2 percent for FY24,\u201d said analyst Ahsan Mehanti at Arif Habib Corp.\n\n\"The global oil price hike impacting growth outlook, weaker rupee and ongoing geo-political tensions played a catalytic role in the bearish close.\"\n\nTraded shares decreased by 106 million shares to 442.096 million shares from 548.418 million shares. The trading value dropped to Rs16.034 billion from Rs21.032 billion. Market capital narrowed to Rs9.795 trillion against Rs9.812 trillion. Of 359 companies active in the session, 148 closed in green, 196 in red and 15 remained unchanged.\n\nAli Najib, an analyst at Topline Securities, said equities kicked off the day on a positive note as the benchmark index made an intraday high at 70,726 level, +242 points, in the morning. \"However, at the day\u2019s high, profit-taking was initiated,\" Najib said. \"Resultantly, the benchmark index could not stay in the green zone and called the day at 70,333 levels.\"\n\nThe aforementioned market behaviour can be accredited to investors\u2019 approach to book profit in energy and fertilizer sector stocks, he added.\n\nConsequently, the day\u2019s negative contributors were EFERT, OGDC, ENGRO, FFC and PPL as they lost 196 points. On the other hand, BAFL, UBL and BAHL saw some buying interest as they added 99 points.\n\nThe highest increase was recorded in Nestle Pakistan Limited shares, which rose by Rs75 to Rs7,600 per share, followed by Ismail Industries Limited, which increased by Rs72.86 to Rs1,072.86 per share. A significant decline was noted in Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited, which fell by Rs31 to Rs8,299 per share, followed by Philip Morris (Pakistan) Limited, which closed lower by Rs15.90 to Rs679 per share.\n\nBrokerage Arif Habib Ltd said the KSE-100 index encountered difficulties in surpassing levels above 70,600, indicating a struggle in the near-term.\n\n\"A sustained move below the crucial 70k mark could trigger a short-term correction in the market,\" the brokerage added.\n\nDespite the challenges, analysts emphasize that holding above the 70,000 level will help maintain upside targets for the market. Investors are closely monitoring market dynamics and corporate earnings reports for further insights into the market direction in the coming days.\n\nPak Refinery remained the volume leader with 39.117 million shares which closed higher by Rs1.82 to Rs28.42 per share. Fauji Cement followed it with 27.951 million shares, which closed higher by 77 paisas to Rs20.34 per share.\n\nOther significant turnover stocks included Kohinoor Spining, Cnergyico PK, Pak Int. Bulk, WorldCall Telecom, PIAC (A), Dewan Motors, Unity Foods Ltd and Faysal Bank.\n\nIn Future Market, 307 companies recorded trading, of which 120 increased, 181 decreased and 6 remained unchanged.",

            "text": "The Federal Shariat Court ruling in April 2022 to eliminate interest from the economy by December 2027 marked a pivotal moment in Pakistan\u2019s financial landscape. The judgment declared an unequivocal prohibition of Riba (including banking interest) in all its manifestations and forms, setting a target to transform the nation into an interest-free economy by the end of 2027. This historic decision necessitates amendments to align all laws and regulations with the essence of this judgment.\n\nThe Federal Shariat Court (FSC) has further ruled that upcoming financial dealings involving Pakistan, be it financing or contracts with international financial bodies, should also adhere to Shariah-compliant financial methods, such as the issuance of Sukuk. This signifies a significant shift towards embracing Islamic finance principles in the country\u2019s financial engagements.\n\nIn Pakistan, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the Islamic banking industry assets have crossed the benchmark of Rs8.1 trillion by June 2023 (approximately $29bn), while the overall Islamic finance industry is reaching close to the Rs10tr mark by adding the market share for the Islamic mutual funds, Sukuk, Modaraba, Islamic Real Estate Investment Trusts and Takaful sectors.\n\nAccording to SBP statistics, at the start of 2002, the Islamic banking industry assets were Rs 5.5tr while deposits were Rs4.2tr with over 5,350 branches. The FSC judgment has provided a positive growth impetus to the industry that grew by over Rs2.5tr in asset size and over Rs1.6tr in terms of deposits in just 18 months, reaching Rs8.1tr in total assets and deposits of over Rs5.8tr.\n\nPakistan is steadily moving towards Shariah compliance across all financial sectors\n\nThe Islamic banking branch network also expanded by 970 branches in just 18 months to make the overall network of Islamic banking branches close to 6,400. The positive growth is likely to continue, with more big banks now eyeing conversion to Islamic banking.\n\nThe growth numbers not only reflect the strength of the value proposition offered by Islamic banking and finance but also reflect the strong grassroots demand for Shariah-compliant financial services and wider acceptance of the conversion roadmap provided by the Shariat Court.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) has also taken the front seat and is taking steps to convert the non-banking financial sector to Islamic principles. Post FSC judgment, the commission issued the Islamic Finance Diagnostic Report early at the start of 2023 and recently issued Guidelines for Offering Islamic Financial Service 2023, while the Islamic Finance department at SECP is working on several initiatives for conversion.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance is also actively working with State-Owned Entities (SOEs) towards formulating conversion strategies to transform their existing financial dealings into the realm of Islamic Finance. This transformative drive reflects a significant commitment to fostering Islamic Finance within the public sector, reshaping the financial landscape in Pakistan.\n\nThe central bank has also provided detailed guidelines and regulatory standards to facilitate conventional banks\u2019 desire to convert their operations as per Shariah principles. The SBP has also played a pivotal role in not only guiding but also facilitating the smooth transition of financial institutions into the Islamic finance realm.\n\nAn exemplary case in point is the remarkable conversion of Faysal Bank Limited to a complete Islamic bank by Dec 2022. This transformation is an unprecedented milestone in Pakistan\u2019s banking history, where a large conventional institution embraced Shariah-compliant principles.\n\nRecently, Summit Bank has announced a conversion to an Islamic bank, and according to news sources, a few other banks, including The Bank of Punjab, ZTBL, and a foreign bank operating in Pakistan, are also considering a complete shift towards becoming Islamic banks.\n\nThe FSC judgment effectively underscores various Sukuk types that the government can utilise in international capital markets to convert existing foreign currency debt and secure new international financing. This guidance is invaluable in facilitating these financial transactions.\n\nThe government has predominantly leaned on bank credit to meet its budgetary requirements, with investments in government securities comprising approximately 48 per cent of the banking sector\u2019s asset base as of the end of December 2022.\n\nA significant portion of these investments primarily involves conventional Market Treasury Bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds, which make up 87.3pc of the banks\u2019 overall holdings in government securities, while Sukuk constitute a relatively smaller share at 12.7pc.\n\nAfter the FSC judgment, the Pakistani government increased its focus on issuing Shariah-compliant Sukuk to replace its interest-based borrowing. In FY22, the government introduced a remarkable 23 Sukuks and successfully raised Rs1.34tr. Fast forward to 2023, in the last nine months, 24 new Sukuk were issued worth Rs1.07tr, taking the total sovereign Sukuk issuance to Rs5.051tr.\n\nThe impact of the FSC judgment and increased acceptance of Islamic finance can be witnessed at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), which now hosts two Islamic indices, namely the KMI-30 index and KMI-All Share Islamic Index to screen the listed companies in line with Shariah guidelines for investments in equities.\n\nThe market capitalisation of Shariah-compliant equities has reached 65pc of the overall market cap by June 2023, showing a positive shift in the corporate sector and increased acceptability of Islamic financial solutions.\n\nAccording to the SECP, the Islamic mutual fund industry is also witnessing robust growth. It has achieved an impressive 45pc market share, while the Shariah-compliant pension funds, targeting retail investors, command a majority market share of 65pc with assets under management of over Rs32 billion by June 30, 2023.\n\nIn conclusion, Pakistan\u2019s embrace of Islamic finance and its journey towards an interest-free economy, driven by the FSC\u2019s historic ruling, is not only reshaping the nation\u2019s financial landscape but also holds great promise for the future.\n\nMr Siddiqui is the Director at IBA\u2019s Centre for Excellence in Islamic Finance.\n\nEmail: aasiddiqui@iba.edu.pk.

Of 370 companies active in the session, 200 closed in green, 149 in red and 21 remained unchanged.\n\nNabeel Haroon, an analyst at Topline Securities, said the positivity in the market can be attributed to news that Saudi Arabia is moving closer to a potential deal to acquire a minority stake in a Pakistan mine controlled by Barrick Gold Corp reiterating recent news flow suggesting Saudi interest in investment in Pakistan.\n\n\"An increase in SBP`s reserves by $14.4 million to $8.055 billion as of April 12, despite the repayment of a one-billion-dollar Eurobond, also gave a boost to investor sentiment.\" Major positive contributions to the index came from HUBC, EFERT, MEBL, BAHL and OGDC, as they cumulatively contributed 329 points to the index.\n\nThe highest increase was recorded in Unilever Pakistan Foods Limited shares, which rose by Rs200 to Rs20,900 per share, followed by Hoechst Pakistan Limited, which increased by Rs97.49 to Rs1,397.49 per share.

Under the new framework, regulatory bodies such as OGRA and the Competition Commission of Pakistan will play a more prominent role in ensuring product quality, availability, and fostering a competitive market environment to deter collusive practices.\n\n\"Looking ahead, weekly support is expected to range between 68.4k to 69.7k, above which targets of 73k to 74k remain viable, indicating continued positive sentiment and potential upside for the market,\" the brokerage said.\n\nPak Refinery remained the volume leader with 49.662 million shares which closed higher by 82 paisas to Rs30.09 per share.

            "text": "The regulatory regime has drastically improved over a decade or so. Right now, everyone has access to information via prompt dissemination of company results and material notices on the PSX. Photo: REUTERS\n\nPakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday came under selling pressure which wiped out all the gains made earlier in the day, caused by weakening global crude oil prices, refinery closure and anticipation ahead of the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) monetary policy announcement.\n\nIn the morning, trading began on a robust note, marked by the intra-day high of 71,846.63 points. The KSE-100 index\u2019s surge was fueled by widespread buying of cyclical stocks, notably in the cement sector, following reports of a nine-year high current account surplus. However, profit-taking at the day\u2019s peak triggered volatility in the market.\n\nThe shift in sentiment came in the wake of withdrawal of Shanghai Electric Power\u2019s acquisition offer to K-Electric (KE) and uncertainty surrounding Pakistan-US relations after trade-boosting agreements between Islamabad and Tehran.\n\nAdditionally, the weaker Pakistani rupee kept the index in the red. Resultantly, the market reached its intra-day low at 71,338.42 towards the close of trading.\n\nThe index ended the day near the day\u2019s low with thin losses, but managed to stay above the 71,000 mark.\n\n\u201cStocks closed under pressure amid higher trading on weak global crude prices, reports of refineries\u2019 shutdown and expectations of a prudent SBP policy announcement next week ahead of IMF loan talks in May,\u201d said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.\n\n\u201cShanghai Electric Power\u2019s withdrawal from the KE acquisition offer, uncertainty about Pakistan-US relations following Pakistan-Iran trade pacts and a weak rupee played the role of catalysts in negative close at the PSX.\u201d\n\nAt close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a decrease of 74.06 points, or 0.1%, and settled at 71,359.41.\n\nTopline Securities, in its report, commented \u201cthe day goes to the cement sector. This market behaviour can be attributed to across-the-board buying of cyclical stocks, especially in the cement sector, in the backdrop of current account surplus of $619 million and in anticipation of 17-18% inflation for April 2024.\u201d\n\nAt the day\u2019s high, profit-taking was initiated in the market. Street expectations were scattered for the upcoming monetary policy from status quo to a reduction of 50-100 basis points.\n\nCement, banking and auto sectors contributed positively to the index where Lucky Cement, United Bank, Habib Bank, Millat Tractors and Maple Leaf Cement added 161 points. On the flip side, Meezan Bank, Faysal Bank and Oil and Gas Development Company Limited (OGDCL) saw some profit-taking as they cumulatively lost 135 points, Topline added.\n\nArif Habib Limited (AHL) wrote that the PSX saw a mixed session with price action staying below Monday\u2019s high.\n\nLucky Cement (+2.17%), United Bank (+1.16%) and Habib Bank (+1.23%) were the biggest contributors to the index gains while Meezan Bank (-2.36%), Faysal Bank (-6.03%) and OGDCL (-1.11%) were the largest drags, it said.\n\n\u201cCement was the standout sector with several stocks hitting their upper limits early in the session before coming off highs later in the day,\u201d AHL added.\n\nJS Global analyst Muhammad Shuja Qureshi said that Tuesday\u2019s volatile session ended with a loss of 74 points. \u201cMore volatility is expected with gains in selective stocks,\u201d he said.\n\nOverall trading volumes increased to 655.9 million shares against Monday\u2019s tally of 655.2 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs24.5 billion.\n\nShares of 371 companies were traded. Of these, 170 stocks closed higher, 179 dropped and 22 remained unchanged.\n\nK-Electric was the volume leader with trading in 67.2 million shares, losing Rs0.23 to close at Rs4.05. It was followed by Pakistan International Bulk Terminal with 46.3 million shares, gaining Rs0.04 to close at Rs6.63 and Fauji Cement with 45.9 million shares, gaining Rs0.19 to close at Rs20.37.\n\nForeign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs346.3 million, according to the NCCPL.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 24th, 2024.",

However, the traded value dipped 21.64pc to Rs24.48bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included K-Elec\u00adtric (67.16m shares), PIBTL (46.34m shares), Fauji Cem\u00adent Company Ltd (45.92m shares), Pak Elektron Ltd (41.28m shares) and Maple Leaf Cement Factory Ltd (24.16m shares).\n\nForeign investors remained net buyers as they picked shares worth $1.24m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 24th, 2024",

Right now, everyone has access to information via prompt dissemination of company results and material notices on the PSX. Photo: REUTERS\n\nPakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday came under slightly downward pressure, sparked by institutional profit-taking in overbought stocks amid the ongoing corporate earnings season.\n\nIn the morning, trading commenced on a positive note, reflecting the previous day\u2019s growth momentum, and the KSE-100 index touched its intra-day high of 72,593.25 points around midday.\n\nInvestor participation in market proceedings remained lacklustre ahead of the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) monetary policy announcement early next week.\n\nThe index faced further pressure due to fears of likely withdrawal of subsidies on the recommendation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Weak global crude oil prices and rupee depreciation also fuelled the bearish momentum.\n\nInvestors took profits in cement and steel sectors, which erased earlier gains and pulled the index down to the intra-day low of 71,700.53. Resultantly, the bourse closed with a thin decline.\n\n\u201cStocks closed under pressure on institutional profit-taking in selected, overbought shares and adjustments in the earnings season,\u201d said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.\n\n\u201cLower global crude oil prices, a weaker rupee, the government\u2019s structural reforms under a new IMF programme for potential withdrawal of subsidies in energy, fertiliser and gas sectors, and expectations of status quo in the SBP policy announcement next week played the role of catalysts in negative close at the PSX.\u201d\n\nAt close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a slight decrease of 80.49 points, or 0.11%, and settled at 71,971.40.\n\nTopline Securities, in its report, said Thursday\u2019s \u201ctrading session at Pakistan\u2019s stock market ended with a slight decrease of 0.11%. During the day, the index reached the intra-day high and low of 72,953 and 71,701 points, respectively\u201d.\n\nOil and gas exploration, auto, banking, cement and fertiliser sectors mainly contributed to the index\u2019s decline, with Millat Tractors, Pakistan Oilfields, Lucky Cement, Faysal Bank and Engro Corporation collectively losing 206 points.\n\nConversely, United Bank, Oil and Gas Development Company, and Engro Fertilisers made positive contributions, adding a total of 167 points, Topline added.\n\nArif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, highlighted that K-Electric surged as the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (Nepra) approved the company\u2019s investment plan and loss assessment for transmission and distribution business for seven years starting FY24.\n\nMillat Tractors (-5.35%) declared 9MFY24 earnings per share (EPS) of Rs40.98, up 269% year-on-year (YoY), but it came in below expectations following a strong run in the last couple of weeks into the December highs.\n\nEngro Corporation (-0.62%) announced 1QCY24 EPS of Rs10.66, up 30% YoY, which also came in below expectations, the AHL report added.\n\nOverall trading volumes increased to 798.5 million shares against Wednesday\u2019s tally of 599.4 million.

            "text": "KARACHI: Share prices of Islamic banks took a beating on Monday, thanks to Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar\u2019s recent statement that customers are getting short-changed by Sharia-compliant lenders by way of insufficient returns on deposits.\n\nSpeaking to a TV host, Dr Akhtar said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) should review the issue of minimum deposit rate (MDR) \u2014 a provision that Islamic banks are currently exempted from.\n\nWith every new finance minister in Islamabad comes a fresh wave of measures aimed at shifting money from the bottom lines of banks to the national exchequer. But for the first time in many years, there\u2019s a proposal on the cards that, if adopted, will transfer money from (Islamic) banks to customers.\n\nBack in 2008 when the current finance minister held the position of SBP governor, the regulator directed banks, including Islamic ones, to pay minimum profit rates on savings accounts. Even though Islamic banks were exempted from the provision in subsequent years, conventional banks are still required to pay a certain rate on all savings accounts.\n\nThe MDR is 150 basis points less than the prevailing benchmark interest rate. In other words, every conventional bank is bound to pay an interest rate of 20.5 per cent to its savings account holders as long as the key interest rate remains 22pc.\n\nAccording to Arif Habib Ltd analyst Sana Tawfik, Islamic banks have been exempted from this requirement to promote Sharia-compliant banking in the country.\n\nAmong the three full-fledged Islamic banks listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), the proportion of savings deposits in their total deposits stood at 40pc for Meezan Bank Ltd, 42pc for Faysal Bank Ltd and 25pc for BankIslami Pakistan Ltd at the end of the September quarter, according to Ms Tawfik.\n\nA sensitivity analysis conducted by her brokerage showed that a 1pc increase in the cost of savings deposits will reduce the earnings per share of Meezan Bank Ltd by Rs2.27, Faysal Bank Ltd by Rs1.35 and BankIslami Pakistan Ltd by Rs0.53.\n\nA research report written by JS Global Head of Research Amreen Soorani stated that Islamic banks are currently offering savings rates that are between seven and 9.5 percentage points lower than the MDR offered by conventional banks.\n\n\u201cThe recent sharp rise in interest rates has widened the said spread, which used to range between 300-500 basis points previously,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, a lender like Meezan Bank Ltd with an outsize market share within the Islamic banking industry is expected to successfully counter the negative impact of the MDR for a host of reasons, she said.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019ll be able to mobilise higher deposits by offering the same returns that are being offered by its conventional peers. \u201cThis would likely boost the volumetric growth of the bank\u2019s deposit base,\u201d she said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 28th, 2023",
