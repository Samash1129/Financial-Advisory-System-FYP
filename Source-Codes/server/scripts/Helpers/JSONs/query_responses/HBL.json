            "text": "HBL Power Systems Limited ( ) shares have had a horrible month, losing 26% after a relatively good period beforehand. Regardless, last month's decline is barely a blip on the stock's price chart as it has gained a monstrous 342% in the last year.\n\nIn spite of the heavy fall in price, given close to half the companies in India have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") below 29x, you may still consider HBL Power Systems as a stock to avoid entirely with its 52.2x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.\n\nWith earnings growth that's exceedingly strong of late, HBL Power Systems has been doing very well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to beat most other companies over the coming period, which has increased investors\u2019 willingness to pay up for the stock. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nIs There Enough Growth For HBL Power Systems?\n\nAlthough there are no analyst estimates available for HBL Power Systems, take a look at this to see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nHBL Power Systems' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.\n\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 145% last year. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 1,650% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.\n\nWeighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 24% shows it's noticeably more attractive on an annualised basis.\n\nWith this information, we can see why HBL Power Systems is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Presumably shareholders aren't keen to offload something they believe will continue to outmanoeuvre the bourse.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From HBL Power Systems' P/E?\n\nA significant share price dive has done very little to deflate HBL Power Systems' very lofty P/E. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\n\nAs we suspected, our examination of HBL Power Systems revealed its three-year earnings trends are contributing to its high P/E, given they look better than current market expectations. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless the recent medium-term conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.\n\nA lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet. Take a look at our with six simple checks on some of these key factors.\n\nIt's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across. So take a peek at this free\n\nValuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

            "text": "The Habib Bank Limited (HBL) plaza pictured in this photo. \u2014 The News File\n\nKARACHI: Habib Bank Limited (HBL), Pakistan\u2019s largest bank by assets, reported a 13 percent increase in its first-quarter net profit on Tuesday, buoyed by a significant rise in interest earned income.\n\nThe Karachi-headquartered bank said its net profit for the quarter ending March 31 was Rs15.043 billion, up from Rs13.256 billion in the same period last year. In a statement to the Pakistan Stock Exchange, HBL declared an interim cash dividend of Rs4 per share and noted that earnings per share rose to Rs10.37, from Rs9.00 a year earlier.\n\nThe bank said its interest earned income for the quarter rose to Rs198.314 billion, compared with Rs148.550billion during the same quarter a year earlier. Interest expensed income also remained higher at Rs137.777 billion from Rs92.707 billion a year ago.\n\nThe bank paid Rs15.069 billion in taxes, up from Rs8.245 billion paid during the same period last year. According to a statement, HBL\u2019s balance sheet stood at Rs5.5 trillion with total deposits closing at Rs4.4 trillion. Domestic deposits grew by more than Rs220 billion reaching Rs3.7 trillion, with current accounts recording their highest first-quarter growth in the last 5 years. Total advances declined by 6 percent over December 2023 to Rs1.75 trillion as credit demand continues to remain subdued.\n\nHowever, the bank\u2019s consumer business maintained its growth trajectory, reaching Rs130 billion in March 2024. The average domestic balance sheet grew by Rs522 billion, leading to a 6 percent increase in net interest income despite falling market yields. This was well supported by growth in revenue from the international business, helped by rising spreads in most markets.\n\nThe bank\u2019s total net interest income thus rose by 8 percent to Rs60.5 billion. HBL continued to lead the market in fees, which posted a stellar growth of 27 percent increasing to Rs11.9 billion in Q1\u201924. The flagship cards business continued to lead, contributing 35 percent of the fee growth, while trade and branch banking also registered strong double-digit fee growth. Consequently, HBL\u2019s total revenue increased by 25 percent to Rs 80.7 billion.\n\n\u201cHBL's strong Q1'24 results showcase our unwavering commitment to client-centricity. The bank saw significant growth across digital channels while enjoying a leadership position in the credit card business,\" Muhammad Nassir Salim, president and CEO of HBL, said in a statement.\n\n\"In the period ahead, the bank\u2019s focus will be on operationalizing its strategy. This means putting its client segmentation approach into action; each segment will be managed as a distinct stream, with defined propositions, channels, and products. HBL will continue accelerating the momentum in its business trajectory.\u201d\n\nFauji Cement profit sees slight increase to Rs7.04 billion\n\nFauji Cement Company Limited reported a profit after tax of Rs7.04 billion for the nine months ending FY24, a slight increase from Rs6.97 billion in the same period last year, despite facing higher financial costs due to expansion-related debt.\n\nThe company's sales revenue rose by 14.4 percent year-on-year to Rs59.4 billion, up from Rs51.91 billion, driven by a 68 percent surge in export sales, which benefited from currency devaluation and lower imported coal prices. However, domestic sales experienced a 4 percent decline.\n\nTotal industry dispatches for the nine-month period reached 34.5 million tonnes, marking a 3 percent increase year-on-year, with Fauji Cement's own dispatches slightly up by 1 percent year-on-year to 3.79 million tonnes.\n\nThe company's gross margins improved to 30.66 percent, compared to 27.09 percent in the same period last year, attributed to enhanced sales prices and cost optimization measures implemented by management.\n\nThe cost-saving initiatives included increased use of local coal, diversification into alternative fuels, a rise in in-house power generation to offset a 35 percent hike in power tariffs, and fixed cost optimization, all contributing to the positive financial outcome.\n\nAdministrative expenses saw a marginal decrease of 0.7 percent year-on-year, while other expenses dropped by 8.3 percent year-on-year. Conversely, selling and distribution expenses witnessed a significant sixfold increase to Rs2.56 billion.\n\nOther income for the company decreased by 8.0 percent year-on-year to Rs571.29 million. The finance cost escalated by 50.3 percent year-on-year to Rs3.77 billion, primarily due to the expansion-related debt and elevated interest rates.\n\nThe tax burden for Fauji Cement also grew, with the company paying Rs3.7 billion in taxes, a 22.9 percent year-on-year increase from Rs3.01 billion paid last year.\n\nISL profit plummets 53.5pc in Q1\n\nInternational Steels Limited (ISL) reported a significant drop in profit after tax for the first quarter of 2024, with earnings falling 53.5 percent year-on-year to Rs705.7 million, down from Rs1.52 billion in the same period last year.\n\nEarning per share remained at Rs1.62.\n\nThe companysaid its revenue decline by 31.9 percent to Rs16.28 billion, compared to Rs23.9 billion in the same period last year. Despite a 30.7 percent reduction in the cost of sales, it was insufficient to counterbalance the decrease in sales, resulting in a 39.8 percent drop in gross profit to Rs1.91 billion for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nGross margins contracted to 11.75 percent, a decrease from 13.28 percent in the same period last year. Other income also experienced a downturn, decreasing by 12.5 percent to Rs48.04 million in the first quarter, from Rs54.91 million.\n\nAdministrative expenses saw a marginal increase of 1.0 percent, while other operating expenses witnessed a significant reduction of 83.1 percent, amounting to Rs105.96 million and Rs55.47 million, respectively. Conversely, selling and distribution expenses soared to Rs767 million, marking a 2.68-fold increase year-on-year.\n\nFinance costs for ISL were down 52.8 percent at Rs186.52 million, compared to Rs394.73 million in the same period last year. The tax expense for the quarter stood at Rs139.48 million, a sharp decline of 76.7 percent year-on-year, from Rs598.38 million paid in the previous year.",

            "text": "Shares of HBL Power Systems have made investors richer with 2400 per cent returns in a span of just 4 years. But the gains have come off after a period of 15 years, before which the stock remained rather muted, i.e., from 2004 to 2019.\n\n\n\nBut after this period, the stock between December 2019 and December 2023 has delivered a 24-time return to its investors. The stock, which was quoting at Rs 16 in December 2019, is now trading around Rs 390.\n\n\n\nAs of Thursday's session (December 7), the stock traded with a gain of over 1 per cent at Rs 394.8. On December 4, the stock logged its all-time high of Rs 409.45 per share, while its all-time low was Rs 5.75 on July 31, 2013.\n\n\n\nWith a m-cap of Rs 10,864 crore, HBL Power Systems is a small-cap stock. The company, with a focus on engineered products and services, is engaged in the design, development, and manufacturing of specialised batteries and direct current systems in India and other engineering products.\n\nTalking about its financials, net income at the company over the last 5 years has grown at a yearly rate of 25.55 per cent, versus the industry average of 4.78 per cent. In the September quarter, net profit at the battery firm more than trebled on a year-on-year basis.\n\nGoing ahead, technicals also hint at a bullish outlook for the counter. Avdhut Bagkar, Derivatives & Technical Analyst, StoxBox, stated that the breakout above the 350 mark has sparked fresh upside in the counter, implying a bullish outlook for the month ahead. Now, if the counter succeeds in crossing the 410 level, the price action could realise a flashy move towards the 440 mark. The trend remains favourable towards a long bias, the analyst added.",

            "text": "The federal government is set to provide preferential treatment to two domestic banks and is willing to take responsibility for their $88 million foreign currency lending to Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) without any restructuring.\n\nThe handling of the foreign currency loan contrasts with the restructuring of PIA\u2019s Rs243 billion domestic debt, which is being extended for 10 years at reduced interest rates.\n\nGovernment sources informed The Express Tribune that this decision will impose an additional burden on the exchequer in the shape of high interest rates in dollar terms and exchange rate risks over the next five years.\n\nUnlike the commercial banks\u2019 domestic lending of Rs243 billion being restructures, the finance ministry has declined advice to convert the $88 million or Rs25 billion foreign loan component into domestic currency, said sources. The government has decided to take over the responsibility of the Rs268 billion commercial banks\u2019 debt to PIA, including the Rs25 billion or $88 million foreign currency loan. A consortium of the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) and Habib Bank Limited (HBL) provided a $88 million loan to PIA at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) plus 5.4%, equivalent to around 11% in dollar terms.\n\nOut of the $88 million, NBP lent $74 million, and HBL\u2019s share was $14 million. The government is considering partially settling the $88 million, with the remaining $53 million to be managed by the government holding company. The Ministry of Finance will then handle the principal and interest payments on the foreign loan, assuming the risks of high interest rates and currency devaluation, said the sources. Despite proposals to reduce the interest rate to 6% in dollar terms and convert the foreign currency loan into domestic financing to save additional interest expenses and avoid exchange rate risks, the Ministry of Finance has not endorsed these suggestions.\n\nRead Apparel industry denounces banks\n\nSources mentioned that the Ministry of Finance is unwilling to reschedule the terms of this financing, unlike the treatment given to the Rs243 billion domestic lending by various banks.\n\nThe foreign loan facility will be settled in five years instead of 10, with the government paying an interest rate equal to SOFR plus 5.4%, close to 11% in dollar terms.\n\nWhen contacted, Ministry of Finance Spokesperson, Qamar Abbasi stated, \u201cThe proposed transfer of the $88 million foreign currency loan is intended to be recorded on the books of Hold Co, similar to the rest of PIA\u2019s commercial debt.\u201d Abbasi mentioned that discussions regarding the terms of transfer are ongoing with the banks.\n\n\u201cVarious proposals are being considered, including converting the loan from foreign currency to PKR, retaining it in its current form, or a combination of both,\u201d Abbasi explained. He further added that the final decision will be made after considering the requirements of the domestic foreign exchange market and determining the appropriate level of foreign exchange risk to be assumed by Hold Co.\n\nThe government and commercial banks have already agreed on a Rs268 billion debt restructuring plan. Sources said that the new term sheet is expected to be signed by the government and banks within the week, paving the way for the issuance of No Objection Certificates by the banks to divide PIA into two and transfer its approximately Rs610 billion debt to a new holding company.\n\nAfter obtaining the NOC, PIA will file a scheme of arrangement with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) to establish the new holding company. This move will shift the burden of PIA\u2019s inefficiency onto taxpayers but will remove an obstacle to its privatisation.\n\nUnder the new term sheet, the government will use proceeds from the PIA sale for principal payments, resorting to the budget if funds are insufficient. In return, banks will accept a 10-year debt rollover with a 12% annual interest rate, resulting in Rs32 billion in annual interest payments from 2024-25 onwards.\n\nThis arrangement means banks will receive over Rs300 billion in interest payments over a decade, exceeding their outstanding stocks of Rs268 billion. The total pay-out to banks at a 12% interest rate will be Rs573 billion over 10 years, said the sources.\n\nPrincipal payments will be made from privatisation proceeds and the sale of other fixed assets. If, however, no proceeds are available, the finance ministry will settle the payments from the budget. The total outstanding debt of the airline is Rs825 billion, and the privatisation ministry and PIA will need no objection certificates from the CAA and FBR to file a scheme of arrangement with the SECP.\n\nThe Privatisation Commission board approved the transaction structure to sell a minimum of 51% stake after cleansing its balance sheet by transferring almost three-fourths of the Rs825 billion to a new company.\n\nThe government has informed the IMF of its plans to sell PIA by June this year.\n\nSources said that any decision to accept the $88 million loan in foreign currency will have significant budgetary implications, as the rupee-dollar parity is expected to fluctuate over the next five years.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 26th, 2024.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",

            "text": "What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in HBL Power Systems' ( ) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for HBL Power Systems:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.26 = \u20b93.0b \u00f7 (\u20b916b - \u20b94.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nTherefore, HBL Power Systems has an ROCE of 26%.

            "short_description": "PIA board approves privatisation plan amid IMF talks  The Express Tribune",
            "text": "The board of directors of Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has approved the government\u2019s plan to privatise the national flag carrier ahead of the country securing a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme, estimating to fetch $250-300 million through the sell-off likely to a Middle Eastern country.\n\nFollowing its reconstitution on Friday, March 22, the board of directors convened its first meeting on Monday and committed to the government\u2019s timeline to privatise PIA by June 15, 2024.\n\nSome meeting participants expressed confidence that PIA\u2019s sell-off would occur before the country secures the next IMF loan package. Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb is expected to formally approach the IMF for a new loan programme at the Fund\u2019s annual meeting in mid-April 2024.\n\nHowever, a source dispelled the impression that PIA privatisation is a prerequisite condition for the IMF\u2019s next loan programme.\n\nThe PIA board formally approved the appointment of international financial advisor, Ernst & Young, for the privatisation transaction.\n\nAccording to a source familiar with the developments surrounding the airline\u2019s sell-off, the advisor\u2019s briefing to the board projected that PIA\u2019s privatisation may fetch $250-300 million for the government.\n\nHowever, the actual value of PIA may differ once interested buyers conduct due diligence of the national carrier.\n\nRead EASA clearance to sweeten PIA sell-off\n\nProgress on the airline\u2019s privatisation front suggests that potential buyers for the national carrier have already expressed their intention to purchase it. They may belong to a Middle Eastern country such as the United Arab Emirate (UAE) or Qatar, the source opined.\n\nIn a notification to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday, PIA Company Secretary Rao Muhammad Imran stated, \u201cthe board of directors of the company in its 83rd meeting held on March 25, 2024 (Monday) has approved the Scheme of Arrangement (SOA) for restructuring and privatisation of Pakistan International Airlines Corporation Limited along with its ancillary modalities, to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).\u201d\n\nThe source noted that this was the first meeting of the PIA board following its reconstitution. The newly appointed board endorsed the government\u2019s decisions on the PIA sell-off, as PIA board approval is necessary to proceed with the Privatisation Commission\u2019s plan in line with governing laws.\n\nHe said, the board approved all the 30 to 40 steps and procedures related to PIA sell-off. Some, such as the appointment of the international financial advisor Ernst & Young, had already taken place before the board\u2019s reconstitution.\n\nHowever, selling PIA in a government-to-government or government-to-private sector deal is not as straightforward as projected, said the source. The airline may find a new owner (for 51% stake with management control) by the given deadline (June 15, 2024) only if all procedures are introduced on time and proceed smoothly.\n\nSuccessfully culminating the privatisation process entails a lot of work, including PIA restructuring, which involves bifurcating the company into two parts. One would hold the core operations of the airline up for sale, while a holding company would manage the debt and liabilities of the airline, including a domestic commercial loan of Rs243 billion and a foreign loan of $88 million.\n\nSpeaking to The Express Tribune, PIA Spokesperson Abdullah Hafeez Khan stated that the board meeting lasted about two-and-a-half to three hours.\n\nHe contradicted reports that the board of directors discussed an early retirement plan, Voluntary Separation Scheme (VSS), or golden handshake.\n\nHe affirmed that the board has committed to implementing the government\u2019s privatisation plan in full compliance and would play its role in achieving the airline\u2019s privatisation on time. PIA has been in the headlines regarding its privatisation for over a decade. Some quarters and political parties in parliament, however, do not find it fitting to sell the loss-making national carrier to a new owner.\n\nThe IMF has urged different governments to sell their loss-making assets to halt injecting around half a trillion rupees into them each year with no benefit. The resources spent on them could be diverted to productive projects.\n\nMeanwhile, the federal government is set to provide preferential treatment to two domestic banks and is willing to take responsibility for their $88 million foreign currency lending to PIA without any restructuring.\n\nThe handling of the foreign currency loan contrasts with the restructuring of PIA\u2019s Rs243 billion domestic debt, which is being extended for 10 years at reduced interest rates.\n\nGovernment sources informed The Express Tribune that this decision will impose an additional burden on the exchequer in the shape of high interest rates in dollar terms and exchange rate risks over the next five years.\n\nOut of the $88 million, NBP lent $74 million, and HBL\u2019s share was $14 million. The government is considering partially settling the $88 million, with the remaining $53 million to be managed by the government holding company.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 27th, 2024.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation",

            "short_description": "Private companies invested in HBL Power Systems Limited (NSE:HBLPOWER) copped the brunt of last week's \u20b96.1b market cap decline  Simply Wall St",
            "text": "Key Insights\n\nThe considerable ownership by private companies in HBL Power Systems indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\n\nAluru Family Private Trust owns 51% of the company\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of HBL Power Systems Limited ( ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 51% to be precise, is private companies. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nAs a result, private companies as a group endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by \u20b96.1b.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about HBL Power Systems.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About HBL Power Systems?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nSince institutions own only a small portion of HBL Power Systems, many may not have spent much time considering the stock. But it's clear that some have; and they liked it enough to buy in. So if the company itself can improve over time, we may well see more institutional buyers in the future. When multiple institutional investors want to buy shares, we often see a rising share price. The past revenue trajectory (shown below) can be an indication of future growth, but there are no guarantees.\n\nWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in HBL Power Systems. Our data shows that Aluru Family Private Trust is the largest shareholder with 51% of shares outstanding. This implies that they have majority interest control of the future of the company. With 3.5% and 1.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, Kavita Aluru and Advay Mikkilineni are the second and third largest shareholders. Advay Mikkilineni, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Member of the Board of Directors. Furthermore, CEO Aluru Prasad is the owner of 1.3% of the company's shares.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.\n\nInsider Ownership Of HBL Power Systems\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nIt seems insiders own a significant proportion of HBL Power Systems Limited. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful \u20b914b stake in this \u20b9140b business. It is good to see this level of investment. You can\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 36% stake in HBL Power Systems. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nIt seems that Private Companies own 51%, of the HBL Power Systems stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past. You can access .\n\nIf you would prefer check out another company -- one with potentially superior financials -- then do not miss this\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

            "text": "Day trading guide for today: Following weak global cues, the Indian stock market ended lower for the third day in a row on Thursday. The Nifty 50 index lost 109 points and closed at the 21,462 level, the BSE Sensex ended 313 points lower at the 71,186 mark while the Nifty Bank index finished 350 points down at the 45,713 level. In the broad market, the small-cap index finished marginally higher whereas the mid-cap index ended marginally lower.\n\n\"Nifty continued its downward trend amid selling pressure in HDFC Bank and weak global cues. The index closed with a loss of 110 points at 21462 levels. Sector-wise it was a mixed bag with buying seen in Pharma, Oil & Gas, Realty, and PSU Bank. Strong retail sales data in the U.S., along with hawkish comments by US Fed speakers spooked investors globally,\" said Siddhartha Khemka, Head - Retail Research at Motilal Oswal.\n\nDay trading guide for stock market today\n\nOn the outlook for the Nifty 50 index, Nagaraj Shetti, Senior Technical Research Analyst at HDFC Securities said, \"The short-term trend of Nifty remains weak. Having declined sharply, there is a possibility of pull pullback rally in the short term, which is expected to be a sell-on-rise opportunity. Important resistance to be watched at 21700-21800 levels. The important lower supports for Nifty today are placed at 21200-21000 levels.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the Bank Nifty today, Kunal Shah, Senior Technical & Derivative Analyst at LKP Securities said, \"The bears maintained control over the Bank Nifty index, leading to a 0.76% decline. The index's immediate support is positioned at the 45500-45400 zone, and a successful defense of this level could trigger a rebound towards 46500. Despite potential short-term fluctuations, the broader trend continues to favor a \"sell on the rise\" approach, suggesting caution and a likelihood of further declines if the mentioned resistance level is not convincingly breached.\"\n\nOn the outlook for the stock market today, Siddhartha Khemka of Motilal Oswal said, \"We expect the market to consolidate in a range with limited upside amid a global uncertain environment. Today, Nifty heavyweights like Reliance, HUL, and Ultratech will announce their results which could drive the index on either side.\"\n\nF&O ban list\n\n13 stocks have been put under the F&O ban list. Those 13 stocks are ABRFL, Ashok Leyland, Balrampur Chini, Bandhan Bank, Delta Corp, Hindustan Copper, IEX, Metropolis, NALCO, Polycab, PVR INOX, SAIL, and ZEEL.\n\nFII DII data\n\nIn the cash segment, FIIs sold out Indian shares worth \u20b99,901.56 crore whereas DIIs bought shares worth \u20b95,977.12 crore.

The recent consolidation phase within the 1240-1270 levels has laid the groundwork for a potential upward movement, accentuated by the emergence of a bullish candlestick pattern on the daily charts. A significant point to note is the presence of a modest resistance zone at \u20b91330 levels, marking a pivotal juncture for MGL. A successful breach of this resistance could act as a catalyst, propelling the stock towards the target of \u20b91370 levels and potentially beyond. It is imperative for investors to closely observe the stock's performance around this resistance, as it holds the key to determining the sustainability of the positive momentum in the short term.\n\n2] Tata Motors: Buy at \u20b9819, target \u20b9860, stop loss \u20b9793.\n\nTata Motors shares exhibiting strong bullish momentum, currently trading at an all-time high of \u20b9819.05 levels. The recent breakout above the crucial resistance at \u20b9815 levels is a significant technical development, supported by robust trading volumes, reinforcing the strength in the stock. The breakthrough suggests a potential continuation of the upward trend, offering an optimistic outlook for investors.\n\nGanesh Dongre's stock of the day\n\n3] Sun Pharma: Buy at \u20b91338, target \u20b91365, stop loss \u20b91320.\n\nIn the short-term trend, Sun Pharma share has a bullish reversal pattern, technically retrenchment could be possible till \u20b91365. So, holding the support level of \u20b91320 this stock can bounce toward the \u20b91365 level in the short term.

            "short_description": "We Think HBL Power Systems (NSE:HBLPOWER) Can Stay On Top Of Its Debt  Simply Wall St",
            "text": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, HBL Power Systems Limited ( ) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is HBL Power Systems's Net Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, at the end of September 2023, HBL Power Systems had \u20b9990.9m of debt, up from \u20b9601.5m a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of \u20b9609.3m, its net debt is less, at about \u20b9381.6m.\n\nHow Healthy Is HBL Power Systems' Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that HBL Power Systems had liabilities of \u20b94.26b due within a year, and liabilities of \u20b9664.1m falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had \u20b9609.3m in cash and \u20b94.54b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has \u20b9222.7m more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nThis state of affairs indicates that HBL Power Systems' balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the \u20b9125.8b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. But either way, HBL Power Systems has virtually no net debt, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nHBL Power Systems's net debt is only 0.15 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 179 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On top of that, HBL Power Systems grew its EBIT by 68% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is HBL Power Systems's earnings that will influence how the balance sheet holds up in the future. So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. .\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. In the last three years, HBL Power Systems basically broke even on a free cash flow basis. Some might say that's a concern, when it comes considering how easily it would be for it to down debt.\n\nOur View\n\nHappily, HBL Power Systems's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But the stark truth is that we are concerned by its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that HBL Power Systems takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - HBL Power Systems has we think you should be aware of.\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.
