            "text": "HBL Power Systems Limited ( ) shares have had a horrible month, losing 26% after a relatively good period beforehand. Regardless, last month's decline is barely a blip on the stock's price chart as it has gained a monstrous 342% in the last year.\n\nIn spite of the heavy fall in price, given close to half the companies in India have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") below 29x, you may still consider HBL Power Systems as a stock to avoid entirely with its 52.2x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.\n\nWith earnings growth that's exceedingly strong of late, HBL Power Systems has been doing very well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to beat most other companies over the coming period, which has increased investors\u2019 willingness to pay up for the stock. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nIs There Enough Growth For HBL Power Systems?\n\nAlthough there are no analyst estimates available for HBL Power Systems, take a look at this to see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nHBL Power Systems' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.\n\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 145% last year. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 1,650% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.\n\nWeighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 24% shows it's noticeably more attractive on an annualised basis.\n\nWith this information, we can see why HBL Power Systems is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Presumably shareholders aren't keen to offload something they believe will continue to outmanoeuvre the bourse.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From HBL Power Systems' P/E?\n\nA significant share price dive has done very little to deflate HBL Power Systems' very lofty P/E. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\n\nAs we suspected, our examination of HBL Power Systems revealed its three-year earnings trends are contributing to its high P/E, given they look better than current market expectations. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless the recent medium-term conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.\n\nA lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet. Take a look at our with six simple checks on some of these key factors.\n\nIt's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across. So take a peek at this free\n\nValuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

            "text": "Shares of HBL Power Systems have made investors richer with 2400 per cent returns in a span of just 4 years. But the gains have come off after a period of 15 years, before which the stock remained rather muted, i.e., from 2004 to 2019.\n\n\n\nBut after this period, the stock between December 2019 and December 2023 has delivered a 24-time return to its investors. The stock, which was quoting at Rs 16 in December 2019, is now trading around Rs 390.\n\n\n\nAs of Thursday's session (December 7), the stock traded with a gain of over 1 per cent at Rs 394.8. On December 4, the stock logged its all-time high of Rs 409.45 per share, while its all-time low was Rs 5.75 on July 31, 2013.\n\n\n\nWith a m-cap of Rs 10,864 crore, HBL Power Systems is a small-cap stock. The company, with a focus on engineered products and services, is engaged in the design, development, and manufacturing of specialised batteries and direct current systems in India and other engineering products.\n\nTalking about its financials, net income at the company over the last 5 years has grown at a yearly rate of 25.55 per cent, versus the industry average of 4.78 per cent. In the September quarter, net profit at the battery firm more than trebled on a year-on-year basis.\n\nGoing ahead, technicals also hint at a bullish outlook for the counter. Avdhut Bagkar, Derivatives & Technical Analyst, StoxBox, stated that the breakout above the 350 mark has sparked fresh upside in the counter, implying a bullish outlook for the month ahead. Now, if the counter succeeds in crossing the 410 level, the price action could realise a flashy move towards the 440 mark. The trend remains favourable towards a long bias, the analyst added.",

It noted that India exports defence equipment to 85-plus nations involving both subsystems/systems, which reached an all-time high of Rs 16,000 crore in FY23 from Rs 690 crore in FY14).\n\nMajor exports from India to Israel, for now, include precious stones and metals, chemical products and textiles.

            "text": "If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in HBL Power Systems' ( ) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for HBL Power Systems:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.20 = \u20b92.2b \u00f7 (\u20b916b - \u20b94.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nThus, HBL Power Systems has an ROCE of 20%. In absolute terms that's a very respectable return and compared to the Electrical industry average of 17% it's pretty much on par.\n\nWhile the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above. If you want to delve into the historical earnings, revenue and cash flow of HBL Power Systems, check out these free .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nThe trends we've noticed at HBL Power Systems are quite reassuring. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 20%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 44% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at HBL Power Systems thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nIn another part of our analysis, we noticed that the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets decreased to 27%, which broadly means the business is relying less on its suppliers or short-term creditors to fund its operations. This tells us that HBL Power Systems has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what HBL Power Systems has. And a remarkable 1,490% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if HBL Power Systems can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\n\nOn a final note, we found you should be aware of.\n\nHBL Power Systems is not the only stock earning high returns.

            "text": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, HBL Power Systems Limited ( ) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is HBL Power Systems's Net Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, at the end of September 2023, HBL Power Systems had \u20b9990.9m of debt, up from \u20b9601.5m a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of \u20b9609.3m, its net debt is less, at about \u20b9381.6m.\n\nHow Healthy Is HBL Power Systems' Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that HBL Power Systems had liabilities of \u20b94.26b due within a year, and liabilities of \u20b9664.1m falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had \u20b9609.3m in cash and \u20b94.54b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has \u20b9222.7m more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nThis state of affairs indicates that HBL Power Systems' balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the \u20b9125.8b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. But either way, HBL Power Systems has virtually no net debt, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nHBL Power Systems's net debt is only 0.15 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 179 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On top of that, HBL Power Systems grew its EBIT by 68% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is HBL Power Systems's earnings that will influence how the balance sheet holds up in the future. So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. .\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. In the last three years, HBL Power Systems basically broke even on a free cash flow basis. Some might say that's a concern, when it comes considering how easily it would be for it to down debt.\n\nOur View\n\nHappily, HBL Power Systems's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But the stark truth is that we are concerned by its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that HBL Power Systems takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - HBL Power Systems has we think you should be aware of.\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

            "text": "Key Insights\n\nThe considerable ownership by private companies in HBL Power Systems indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\n\nAluru Family Private Trust owns 51% of the company\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of HBL Power Systems Limited ( ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 51% to be precise, is private companies. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nAs a result, private companies as a group endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by \u20b96.1b.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about HBL Power Systems.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About HBL Power Systems?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nSince institutions own only a small portion of HBL Power Systems, many may not have spent much time considering the stock. But it's clear that some have; and they liked it enough to buy in. So if the company itself can improve over time, we may well see more institutional buyers in the future. When multiple institutional investors want to buy shares, we often see a rising share price. The past revenue trajectory (shown below) can be an indication of future growth, but there are no guarantees.\n\nWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in HBL Power Systems. Our data shows that Aluru Family Private Trust is the largest shareholder with 51% of shares outstanding. This implies that they have majority interest control of the future of the company. With 3.5% and 1.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, Kavita Aluru and Advay Mikkilineni are the second and third largest shareholders. Advay Mikkilineni, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Member of the Board of Directors. Furthermore, CEO Aluru Prasad is the owner of 1.3% of the company's shares.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.\n\nInsider Ownership Of HBL Power Systems\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nI generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions.\n\nIt seems insiders own a significant proportion of HBL Power Systems Limited. It is very interesting to see that insiders have a meaningful \u20b914b stake in this \u20b9140b business. It is good to see this level of investment. You can\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nThe general public, who are usually individual investors, hold a 36% stake in HBL Power Systems. While this group can't necessarily call the shots, it can certainly have a real influence on how the company is run.\n\nPrivate Company Ownership\n\nIt seems that Private Companies own 51%, of the HBL Power Systems stock. It might be worth looking deeper into this. If related parties, such as insiders, have an interest in one of these private companies, that should be disclosed in the annual report. Private companies may also have a strategic interest in the company.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nWhile it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important.\n\nI like to dive deeper into how a company has performed in the past.
