The Board of Directors has declared final cash dividend of Rs. 9.0 per share i.e. 90%, in addition to 210% already paid, bringing the total cash dividend for the year 2023 to 300%.\n\nThrough focused efforts of the Bank\u2019s management in building no-cost deposits and\n\noptimizing its earning assets mix, MCB achieved significant growth in core earnings to post a historic Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 125.2 billion; registering an impressive increase of\n\n75% over last year. The Profit After Tax (PAT) was recorded at Rs. 59.6 billion (+82%) and\n\ntranslated into an Earning Per Share (EPS) of Rs. 50.32 compared to an EPS of Rs. 27.63\n\nreported in the last year.\n\nAided by a strong volumetric growth in current account and timely repositioning of the asset book, net interest income for the year 2023 increased by 69% as compared to last year.\n\nNon-markup income increased to Rs. 32.9 billion (+34%) against Rs. 24.6 billion in the last\n\nyear with major contributions coming in from fee commission income (Rs. 20.2 billion),\n\nincome from dealing in foreign currency (Rs. 8.5 billion) and dividend income (Rs. 3.0\n\nbillion).\n\nImproving customer and interbank flows, diversification of revenue streams through\n\ncontinuous enrichment of service suite, investments towards digital transformation and an\n\nunrelenting focus on upholding high standards of service delivery supplemented a broad-\n\nbased growth of 43% in income from fee commission; with trade and guarantee related\n\nbusiness income growing by 111%, cards related income by 49%, branch banking customer fees by 14% and income from home remittance by 26%.\n\nThe Bank continues to manage an efficient operating expense base and monitor costs\n\nprudently.

The cost to income ratio of the Bank improved significantly to 29% from\n\n37% reported in the last year.\n\nNavigating a challenging operating and macroeconomic environment, the Bank has been\n\naddressing asset quality issues by maintaining discipline in management of its risk return\n\ndecisions. Diversification of loan book across customer segments and a robust credit\n\nunderwriting framework that encompasses structured assessment models, effective pre-\n\ndisbursement evaluation tools and an array of post disbursement monitoring systems has\n\nenabled MCB to effectively manage its credit risk; the Non-performing loan (NPLs) base of\n\nthe Bank was reported at Rs. 53.9 billion as at December 31, 2023. The coverage and\n\ninfection ratios of the Bank were reported at 82.70% and 8.66% respectively.\n\nOn the financial position side, the total asset base of the Bank grew by 16% and was\n\nreported at Rs. 2.43 trillion.

The average current to\n\ntotal deposits ratio improved to 50.5% in the year 2023 as compared to 42.2% in the last\n\nyear.

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Equity prices staged a strong rebound at the Pakistan Stock Exchange on Tuesday thanks to the policy rate status quo and optimism about the imminent Staff-Level Agreement with the IMF following the wrapping of the final review.\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s decision to maintain the policy rate at 22pc for the sixth consecutive monetary policy review boosted the market confidence as enthusiastic investors picked shares at attractive levels triggering an across-the-board buying spree.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the KSE-100 index opened on a positive note as it gained 734.22 points in early trade. Furthermore, whispers of institutional buying circulated, casting a favourable light on the market and contributing to its upward momentum.\n\nA widespread surge of buying activity swept through the market, with banks, fertiliser and exploration & production sectors emerging as the day\u2019s primary beneficiaries where MCB Bank, Meezan Bank Ltd, HabibMetro Bank, Bank Al-Habib, Engro Fertilisers, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Pakistan Oilfield Ltd and Mari Petroleum cumulatively contributed 319 points to the index.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said Pakistan\u2019s targeting of terrorist hideouts inside Afghanistan also boosted market sentiments.\n\nHe added that the reports about the SBP Governor\u2019s assurance for a $2bn rollover in two weeks and plans to seek $4bn further payment rollovers played a catalyst role in the bullish close at the PSX.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 65,502.60 points after staging a rally of 612.09 points or 0.94 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume swelled 52.66pc to 323.28 million shares. The traded value also surged by 119.12pc to Rs17.05bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom (27.82m shares), Telecard Ltd (20.82m shares), The Bank of Punjab (17.91m shares), Hascol Petroleum Ltd (16.62m shares) and Unity Foods Ltd (15.91m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs200.00), Pakistan Tobacco (Rs67.20), Indus Motor Ltd (Rs48.58), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs47.90) and Mehmood Textile (Rs16.82).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Sapphire Fibres Ltd(Rs91.67), Nest\u00adle Pakis\u00adtan (Rs80.00), Ibrahim Fib\u00adres (Rs29.92), Murree Bre\u00adwery (Rs6.48) and Dawood Lawrencepur (Rs5.62).\n\nForeign investors remained net sellers as they offloaded shares worth $1.65m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 20th, 2024",

            "text": "KARACHI: The stock market turned in a cautious performance on Monday ahead of the monetary policy announcement as a result the benchmark index managed to post modest gains with a sharp contraction in the trading volume.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the equities kicked off the week on a positive note as the benchmark KSE 100 index rose 332 to 65,148 points in early trade amid hopes of a positive outcome of the ongoing IMF final review under the current $3bn Stand-By Arran\u00adgement, which would pave the way for the release of last tranche of $1.1bn.\n\nHowever, the uncertain interest rate outlook unsettled a section of investors who resorted to profit-taking at the day\u2019s high level resultantly the index lost some of its initial gains.\n\nThe equity investors adopted a cautious approach ahead of the monetary policy announcement, which was to be unveiled later in the day. A majority of market pundits were expecting a status quo given the ongoing IMF review of the economy and spike in Ramazan-driven inflationary pressure.\n\nFertiliser, banks and power sectors contributed positively to the index as Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank Ltd, Hub Power, United Bank Ltd Dawood Hercules cumulatively added 141 points to the index. On the other hand, Lucky Cement, Systems Ltd and MCB Bank came under heavy selling wiping out 72 points.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the surging global crude oil prices and strong rupee helped the market to remain in the green.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,890.51 points after gaining 74.04 points or 0.11 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading tumbled 18.35pc to 211.75 million shares. The traded value also declined 23.07pc to Rs7.78bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom (16.60m shares), Hascol Petroleum Ltd (16.26m shares), Telecard Ltd (14.67m shares), PTCL (13.81m shares) and K-Electric (12.95m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Pakistan Hotels (Rs19.98), Pakistan Tobacco (Rs11.00), Thal Ltd (Rs8.98), KASB Pumps (Rs5.20) and Bolan Castings (Rs6.46).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Ismail Industries (Rs60.00), Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs35.83), JDW Sugar (Rs20.90), Colgate Palm\u00adolive (Rs19.17) and Sazgar Engineering (Rs15.64).\n\nForeign investors rema\u00adined net buyers as they purchased shares worth $0.39m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 19th, 2024",

            "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) recorded gains of just 0.4% in the outgoing week as investors awaited the International Monetary Fund (IMF) review and monetary policy announcement next week.\n\nInvestors\u2019 interest was driven by encouraging corporate results, which triggered activity in specific stocks while some results did not meet market expectations, leading to selling pressure.\n\nContinuously depreciating rupee and a significant fall in the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) foreign currency reserves piled pressure on the bourse, which restricted the market\u2019s rapid advance.\n\nAt the beginning of the week, the PSX commenced trading on a robust note as it crossed the psychological barrier of 51,000 points owing to investor confidence aided by easing political uncertainties and positive economic data projections.\n\nHowever, the market lost momentum on Tuesday in a volatile session owing to selling pressure arising from geopolitical tensions and anxiety about the IMF\u2019s review under the $3 billion standby arrangement. On Wednesday, the bourse recovered, driven by earnings announcements and optimism about the IMF review, which would lead to the release of second loan tranche of $700 million.\n\nOn Thursday, the KSE-100 index ended nearly flat in range-bound trading as investors\u2019 spirit weakened over depreciation of Pakistani rupee and the decline in foreign currency reserves.\n\nOn the last day of the trading week, the index suffered losses as bears took the driving seat ahead of the monetary policy announcement and due to the looming uncertainty surrounding talks with the IMF.\n\nThe market closed at 50,944, up 212 points, or 0.42% week-on-week (WoW). In his market review, JS Global analyst Muhammad Waqas Ghani wrote that the KSE-100 index closed the week at 50,944, gaining 0.4% WoW. However, average volumes dropped 10% WoW to 366 million shares.\n\n\u201cAbove-expected earnings/ dividends announcement by Bank AL Habib, Fauji Cement, MCB Bank and Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans triggered activity in these stocks,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other hand, below-expected earnings and dividend announcement by Fauji Fertiliser Company impacted investors\u2019 sentiment and led to a 3.3% WoW decline in the stock\u2019s price. During the week, the auto assemblers announced 2-3% reduction in car prices to account for the recent appreciation of the rupee.\n\nOn the political front, the PML-N supremo returned to Pakistan who cited reduction in government expenditures, increase in tax revenue, rise in exports, IT sector reforms and improving relations with neighbouring countries as top issues on his party\u2019s agenda.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, as the IMF review was approaching fast, the government became more aggressive in pursuing its economic targets and implementing policy measures.\n\nOn a similar note, the ECC approved the much-awaited increase in gas prices while the budget deficit contracted to 0.9% of GDP in 1QFY24 from 1% of GDP during the same period of last year.\n\nPakistan also surpassed its primary surplus criterion set by the IMF, which was reported at 0.4% of GDP for 1QFY24, the JS analyst added. Arif Habib Limited (AHL) commented that the market kicked off trading on a positive note, driven by the approval of gas tariff hike, a significant step towards meeting one of the prerequisites for the IMF\u2019s review scheduled to commence on November 2, 2023.\n\nNotably, the current account deficit was recorded at $8 million for September 2023, down 95% month-on-month. \u201cThe momentum was further bolstered by the results season, which contributed to the positive trajectory,\u201d it said.\n\nHowever, the consistent appreciation of the rupee ended, resulting in the currency closing at Rs280.57 against the greenback, depreciating by Rs1.77, or 0.64% WoW. Moreover, SBP\u2019s reserves decreased $220 million to $7.5 billion, AHL said.\n\nForeigners turned net sellers as they sold stocks worth $3.47 million compared to net buying of $2.32 million last week, AHL added.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, October 29th, 2023.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",
