The cost to income ratio of the Bank improved significantly to 29% from\n\n37% reported in the last year.\n\nNavigating a challenging operating and macroeconomic environment, the Bank has been\n\naddressing asset quality issues by maintaining discipline in management of its risk return\n\ndecisions. Diversification of loan book across customer segments and a robust credit\n\nunderwriting framework that encompasses structured assessment models, effective pre-\n\ndisbursement evaluation tools and an array of post disbursement monitoring systems has\n\nenabled MCB to effectively manage its credit risk; the Non-performing loan (NPLs) base of\n\nthe Bank was reported at Rs. 53.9 billion as at December 31, 2023.

The average current to\n\ntotal deposits ratio improved to 50.5% in the year 2023 as compared to 42.2% in the last\n\nyear.

Despite the decline, Bank Al-Falah declared an interim cash dividend of Rs2.0 per share.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) were reported at Rs6.31, down from RS6.83 per share year-on-year.\n\nThe financial statement highlighted a robust increase in interest income, which soared to Rs128.652 billion from Rs75.600 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. Conversely, interest expenses also surged to Rs97.785 billion, up from Rs27.913 billion.\n\nThe higher tax bill, which rose to Rs9.886 billion from Rs8.258 billion, was noted as a key factor impacting the bank's profit margins for the quarter.\n\nThe bank\u2019s non-markup Income (NMI) also rose by 19.51 percent year-on-year to Rs8.08 billion, owing to a significant rise in fee and commission income, foreign exchange income, and gain from derivatives to clock in at Rs4.53 billion, Rs2.3 billion and Rs297.55 million, respectively.\n\nOn the expense side, the total non-interest expenses increased by 26.71 percent year-on-year to Rs19.16 billion in 3QFY24 compared to Rs15.12 billion in 3QFY23.\n\nThe increase was attributed to the massive jump of 25.92 percent year-on-year in operating expenses from Rs14.71 billion in 3QFY23 to Rs18.52 billion in 3QFY24.\n\nABL\u2019s first-quarter profit jumps 51pc to Rs11.6 billion\n\nAllied Bank Limited (ABL) announced a robust 51 percent increase in its first-quarter net profit, driven by a surge in interest earned income.\n\nIn a statement released to the Pakistan Stock Exchange, the bank reported a net profit of Rs11.606 billion for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, compared to Rs7.684 billion during the same period last year.\n\nThe bank also announced an interim cash dividend of Rs4.0 a share.

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Strong inter\u00adnational interest following significant progress tow\u00adards privatisation of the national flag carrier and optimism about IMF in\u00adflows early next month further boosted investor confidence triggering a fresh buying spree tossing the benchmark KSE 100-share index to an all-time high closing above 66,500 level.\n\nPreviously, the index did cross the pivotal level several times in recent weeks but could not sustain the gains above that level.\n\nThe approval of the 11-member board of directors of PIA Holding Company with former SBP governor Tariq Bajawa as its chairman by the federal cabinet on Tuesday was considered a major development which would speed up the privatisation of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA).\n\nThe cabinet also approved that the liabilities and assets of the loss-making national carrier would be transferred to the holding company, which would be registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan.\n\nInterestingly, the majority of the independent directors on the holding company\u2019s board are the heads of commercial banks, including Bank Alfalah CEO Atif Aslam Bajwa and United Bank chief executive Shahzad Dada.\n\nSeparately, the aviation ministry confirmed that it had received investor interest in the PIA transaction from several countries including Germany, France, The Netherlands, Qatar, the UAE, Malaysia and Turkiye which also sparked enthusiasm among the local investors.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said besides PIA privatisation, the rupee stability, PM commitments over CPEC second phase and expected foreign inflows also helped the market to scale a new closing peak.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the market finally settled above the pivotal level as investors chose to further strengthen their equity position by buying blue-chip scrips across the board.\n\nResultantly, the power, bank & fertiliser sectors contributed positively to the index as Hub Power, Meezan Bank, United Bank, MCB Bank and Engro Corporation cumulatively added 319 points to the index.\n\nOn the other hand, Pakistan Petroleum, National Bank and Millat Tractors attracted some profit-taking wiping out 67 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at an all-time high of 66,547.79 points after staging a robust rally of 641.51 points or 0.97 per cent from the preceding session. Its previous all-time high closing was 66,427.78 points on Dec 12. 2023.\n\nThe overall trading volume rose further by 16.75pc to 354.59 million shares. The traded value, however, fell 1.60pc to Rs11.88bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Lotte Chemical (42.83m shares), Telecard Ltd (29.17m shares), Pakistan Tele\u00adcomm\u00adunication Com\u00adpany Ltd (24.70m shares), The Organic Meat Company Ltd (18.79m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (16.03m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan (Rs235.00), Shahmurad Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs31.38), Hallmark Company Ltd (Rs30.32), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs23.92) and Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs11.64).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs240.00), Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs106.50), Unilever Foods (Rs100.00), Hoechst Pakistan (Rs93.87) and Sapphire Textile (Rs84.05).\n\nForeign investors continued picking shares as their next purchase worth $0.33m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 28th, 2024",

            "text": "The Board of Directors of MCB Bank Limited (MCB) in its meeting under the Chairmanship of Mian Mohammad Mansha, on April 24, 2024, reviewed the performance of the Bank and approved the condensed interim financial statements for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nThe Board of Directors has declared first interim cash dividend of Rs. 9.0 per share i.e. 90% for the quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nThrough focused efforts of the Bank\u2019s management in maintaining no-cost deposits base and optimizing its earning assets mix, MCB\u2019s Profit Before Tax (PBT) for the first quarter of 2024 increased to Rs 32.5 billion with an impressive growth of 41%. Profit After Tax (PAT) posted a growth of 27% to reach Rs. 16.6 billion; translating into Earning Per Share (EPS) of Rs. 13.97 compared to an EPS of Rs 11.02 reported in the corresponding period last year.\n\nOn the back of strong volumetric growth in average current deposits (+13% on a YoY basis) and timely repositioning within the asset book, net interest income for 1Q\u201924 increased by 27% over corresponding period last year.\n\nNon-markup income increased to Rs. 9.1 billion (+54%) against Rs. 5.9 billion in the corresponding period last year with major contributions coming in from fee commission income of Rs. 6.1 billion (+46%), income from dealing in foreign currency of Rs. 1.9 billion (+97%) and dividend income of Rs. 1.0 billion (+55%).\n\nImproving customer and interbank flows, diversification of revenue streams through continuous enrichment of service suite, investments towards digital transformation and an unrelenting focus on upholding high standards of service delivery supplemented a broad-based growth in income from fee commission; with trade and guarantee related business income growing by 100%, cards related income by 48%, branch banking customer fees by 17% and income from home remittance by 55%.\n\nThe Bank continues to manage an efficient operating expense base and monitor costs prudently. Amidst a persistently high inflationary environment, rapidly escalating commodity prices and continued investments in human resources and technological upgradation, the operating expenses of the Bank were reported at Rs. 13.9 billion (+18%). The cost to income ratio of the Bank improved to 29.50% from 32.77% reported in the corresponding period last year.\n\nNavigating a challenging operating and macroeconomic environment, the Bank has been addressing asset quality issues by maintaining discipline in management of its risk return decisions. Diversification of the loan book across customer segments and a robust credit underwriting framework that encompasses structured assessment models, effective pre-disbursement evaluation tools and an array of post disbursement monitoring systems has enabled MCB to effectively manage its credit risk; the Non-performing loan (NPLs) base of the Bank was reported at Rs. 55.4 billion as at March 31, 2024. The coverage and infection ratios of the Bank were reported at 92.67% and 8.56% respectively.\n\nOn the financial position side, the total asset base of the Bank was reported at Rs. 2.41 trillion with nominal decrease of 1% over Dec 2023. Analysis of the assets mix highlights that net investments and gross advances have increased by Rs. 39 billion (+3%) and Rs. 25 billion (+4%) over December 31, 2023 respectively whereas Lending to Financial Institutions decreased by Rs. 46 billion (-48%).\n\nThe Bank\u2019s total deposits crossed Rs. 1.85 trillion while the domestic market share improved to 6.05% compared to 5.92% as at December 31, 2023. The domestic cost of deposits was contained at 10.70% as compared to 7.15% in the corresponding period of last year despite the significant increase in average policy rate during the period.\n\nReturn on Assets and Return on Equity improved to 2.74% and 31.54% respectively, whereas the book value per share was reported at Rs 180.02.\n\nDuring the period under review, MCB attracted home remittance inflows of USD 892 million (+13%) to consolidate its position as an active participant in SBP\u2019s cause for improving flow of remittances into the country through banking channels.\n\nWhile complying with the regulatory capital requirements, the Bank\u2019s total Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) is 19.62% against the requirement of 11.5% (including capital conservation buffer of 1.50% as reduced under the BPRD Circular Letter No. 12 of 2020). Quality of the capital is evident from Bank\u2019s Common Equity Tier-1 (CET1) to total risk weighted assets ratio which comes to 16.50% against the requirement of 6%.\n\nBank\u2019s capitalization also resulted in a Leverage Ratio of 6.5% which is well above the regulatory limit of 3.0%. The Bank reported Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) of 263.47% and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) of 160.47% against requirement of 100%.\n\nPakistan Credit Rating Agency re-affirmed credit ratings of MCB at \u201cAAA / A1+\u201d for long term and short term respectively, through its notification dated June 23, 2023.\n\nTo retain and further consolidate its market position, the Bank has continued to invest in the upgradation of its existing locations with the objective of enhancing customer experiences while the digital access points are being continuously augmented to extend customer outreach. The Bank on consolidated basis is operating the 2nd largest network of more than 1,650 branches in Pakistan. The Bank remains one of the prime stocks traded in the Pakistani equity market with 2nd highest market capitalization in the industry.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Equity prices staged a strong rebound at the Pakistan Stock Exchange on Tuesday thanks to the policy rate status quo and optimism about the imminent Staff-Level Agreement with the IMF following the wrapping of the final review.\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s decision to maintain the policy rate at 22pc for the sixth consecutive monetary policy review boosted the market confidence as enthusiastic investors picked shares at attractive levels triggering an across-the-board buying spree.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the KSE-100 index opened on a positive note as it gained 734.22 points in early trade. Furthermore, whispers of institutional buying circulated, casting a favourable light on the market and contributing to its upward momentum.\n\nA widespread surge of buying activity swept through the market, with banks, fertiliser and exploration & production sectors emerging as the day\u2019s primary beneficiaries where MCB Bank, Meezan Bank Ltd, HabibMetro Bank, Bank Al-Habib, Engro Fertilisers, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Pakistan Oilfield Ltd and Mari Petroleum cumulatively contributed 319 points to the index.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said Pakistan\u2019s targeting of terrorist hideouts inside Afghanistan also boosted market sentiments.\n\nHe added that the reports about the SBP Governor\u2019s assurance for a $2bn rollover in two weeks and plans to seek $4bn further payment rollovers played a catalyst role in the bullish close at the PSX.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 65,502.60 points after staging a rally of 612.09 points or 0.94 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume swelled 52.66pc to 323.28 million shares.

            "text": "Segregation of client assets is critical as brokers have been penalised for using client money illegally. PHOTO: AFP\n\nPakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday soared to a record high as it crossed the 66,500 milestone over progress in the privatisation process for state-owned Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) and optimism about a new, larger International Monetary Fund (IMF) loan programme.\n\nAs trading commenced in the morning, the bourse continued its upward march with investors pushing the KSE-100 index above the resistance level of 66,000, which the market had failed to breach in the past many days.\n\nThe index got a boost from the PIA board of directors\u2019 approval of the government\u2019s plan to privatise the national flag carrier, ahead of securing the new IMF loan programme.\n\nPrime Minister Shehbaz Sharif\u2019s statement that an agreement on the second phase of China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was expected to be signed with Beijing soon rejuvenated investor confidence. Major contribution to the bullish momentum came from banking and fertiliser sectors.\n\nThe upward momentum was further aided by the rupee\u2019s continuous stability, which took the KSE-100 to the intra-day high of 66,607.87. The index after shedding some points in the final hour closed above the 66,500 level.\n\n\u201cStocks closed at a record high as government deliberated the PIA privatisation process and global investors\u2019 interest in the ailing SOE (state-owned enterprise),\u201d said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.\n\nRead PSX extends gains, nears 66,000 mark\n\n\u201cRupee stability, PM\u2019s commitment to the second phase of CPEC and foreign fund inflows played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.\u201d At close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded a surge of 641.51 points, or 0.97%, and settled at 66,547.79.\n\nTopline Securities\u2019 Deputy Head of Sales Ali Najib reported that finally the index broke the 66,000 barrier, which could be attributed to \u201cpositive vibes from the IMF, rejuvenated foreign interest at historically low valuations and progress on SOE privatisation\u201d.\n\nInvestors chose to further strengthen their equity positions by buying blue-chip stocks across the board, he said. Resultantly, power, banking and fertiliser sectors contributed positively to the index as Hub Power, Meezan Bank, United Bank, MCB Bank and Engro Corporation added a total of 319 points.\n\nOn the flip side, Pakistan Petroleum, the National Bank of Pakistan and Millat Tractors saw some profit-taking as they cumulatively lost 67 points, he added.\n\nArif Habib Limited (AHL), in its review, wrote that the 66,000 resistance level was finally breached and it should now support the ascent to new all-time highs.\n\nAccording to Finance Minister Muhammad Aurangzeb, Pakistan will be looking to conclude an IMF agreement for a new loan programme by the end of June or early July, it said.\n\nAHL added that investors would be focusing on the FTSE equity country classification review after the close of US markets on Thursday, where Pakistan was on the watch list for potential demotion from secondary emerging to frontier market status.\n\nJS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala observed that the bourse made a significant breakthrough as the KSE-100 index surpassed the resistance level of 66,200.\n\nConsiderable investor interest was seen in banking and fertiliser sectors, he said. \u201cLooking ahead, we suggest investors to consider a buy-on-dips strategy, particularly focusing on banking, E&P and technology sectors,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nOverall trading volumes increased to 354.6 million shares against Tuesday\u2019s tally of 303.7 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs11.9 billion.\n\nShares of 346 companies were traded. Of these, 179 stocks closed higher, 152 dropped and 15 remained unchanged.\n\nLotte Chemical was the volume leader with trading in 42.8 million shares, gaining Rs0.55 to close at Rs19.53. It was followed by Telecard Limited with 29.2 million shares, gaining Rs0.75 to close at Rs9.24 and PTCL with 24.7 million shares, gaining Rs1.21 to close at Rs17.31. Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs94.3 million, according to the NCCPL.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 28th, 2024.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",

            "short_description": "PSX bounces back on SBP, IMF optimism  The Express Tribune",
            "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday experienced a modest recovery, fueled by anticipation surrounding the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) monetary policy announcement and optimism about the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) final review under its standby arrangement (SBA).\n\nIn the morning, trading began on a positive note but the KSE-100 index soon plunged to the intra-day low at 64,811.92 points. Thereafter, it recovered rapidly and after frequent ups and down, the index reached the intra-day high at 65,148.36 points.\n\nAt that point, investors got an opportunity to opt for profit-taking over caution ahead of the monetary policy announcement scheduled for around 4pm. Resultantly, the bourse fell close to its intra-day low post-midday trading, slipping below the 65,000 mark.\n\nNevertheless, the market rebounded, propelled by surging global crude oil prices and strengthening of the Pakistani rupee, driven by optimism surrounding the IMF\u2019s review for the release of $1.2 billion loan tranche. Fertiliser, banking and power sectors mainly contributed positively to the index.\n\nDespite closing below 65,000, the market managed to recover all the earlier losses, ending the day positively. \u201cStocks showed recovery on speculation ahead of SBP\u2019s announcement later today (Monday) and hopes for a productive final IMF review for the release of SBA tranche,\u201d said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.\n\nRead: PSX under pressure over IMF talk concerns\n\n\u201cSurging global crude oil prices and stronger rupee played the role of catalysts in positive close at the PSX.\u201d\n\nAt close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 74.04 points, or 0.11%, and settled at 64,890.51. Topline Securities Deputy Head of Sales Ali Najib, in his report, said \u201cPakistan equities kicked off the week on a positive note as the KSE-100 index touched intra-day high at 65,148 (+332 points; or 0.51%) in the morning. However, at the day\u2019s high, profit-taking kicked in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis market behaviour can be attributed to a cautious approach adopted by investors ahead of monetary policy announcement (scheduled at around 4pm),\u201d he said. A majority at the street expected the central bank to maintain the status quo. However, a surprise reduction in rate would be taken positively by the PSX, Najib added.\n\nFertiliser, banking and power sectors contributed positively to the index as Fauji Fertiliser, Meezan Bank, Hub Power, United Bank and Dawood Hercules cumulatively added 141 points.\n\nOn the flip side, Lucky Cement, Systems Limited and MCB Bank saw some profit-taking as they lost 72 points, Topline added.\n\nArif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, commented that there was \u201ca dull start to the week ahead of the SBP rate decision where views were mixed regarding the start of an easing cycle now or later in the year.\u201d\n\nTop index contributors were Fauji Fertiliser (+2.03%), Meezan Bank (+1.8%) and Hub Power (+0.98%), it said, adding that Pakistan Telecommunication Company (+7.58%) was the standout performer, which kept the tech sector in the limelight and had gained 29.47% month to date. JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that the PSX saw range-bound activity with the KSE-100 index closing at 64,890 with gains of 74 points.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we recommend investors to consider any downside as an opportunity to buy stocks in banking, and exploration and production (E&P) sectors,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nOverall trading volumes decreased to 211.8 million shares against Friday\u2019s tally of 259.4 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs7.8 billion.\n\nShares of 328 companies were traded. Of these, 145 stocks closed higher, 158 dropped and 25 remained unchanged.\n\nWorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 16.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.02 to close at Rs1.36. It was followed by Hascol Petroleum with 16.3 million shares, losing Rs0.28 to close at Rs8.28 and Telecard Limited with 14.7 million shares, gaining Rs0.33 to close at Rs9. Foreign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs110.7 million, according to the NCCPL.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, March 19th, 2024.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",

            "text": "Segregation of client assets is critical as brokers have been penalised for using client money illegally. PHOTO: AFP\n\nPakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday showed signs of recovery as investors took cue from the decline in inflation reading to 20.68% for March 2024, which could lead to an easing of monetary policy by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).\n\nEarlier, trading began on a positive note but soon the KSE-100 index dropped and hit its intra-day low of 66,573.63 points, reflecting the loss suffered in the previous session. However, the market started rising gradually, driven by the robust performance of global stocks and increase in international crude oil prices.\n\nAdditionally, government discussions on the privatisation of struggling state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and rupee stability following a staff-level agreement (SLA) between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also contributed to the bullish momentum.\n\nConsequently, the index reached the intra-day high at 66,959.54 points, falling just short of the 67,000 mark. With some profit-taking at the peak where investors seemed cautious ahead of Eid holidays, the market closed with thin gains.\n\n\u201cStocks showed recovery as investors weighed 20.68% CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation for March 2024, which is likely to lead to the easing of SBP policy next month,\u201d said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.\n\n\u201cSurging global stocks and crude oil prices, government deliberations on privatisation of ailing SOEs and rupee stability after Pakistan-IMF SLA in the final review played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.\u201d\n\nAt close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 89.94 points, or 0.13%, and settled at 66,886.26.\n\nTopline Securities, in its report, said Pakistan equities kicked off the day on a positive note as the KSE-100 index reached its intra-day high just below 67,000 at 66,960 (+163 points). However, at the day\u2019s high, profit-taking initiated.\n\n\u201cThis market behaviour can be attributed to investors\u2019 stance to remain sidelined ahead of Eid holidays scheduled for next week and in the absence of any triggers, which may influence market direction,\u201d it said.\n\nThe day\u2019s positive contributors were Dawood Hercules Corporation, Systems Limited, Fauji Fertiliser, MCB Bank and Bank Alfalah, which added 202 points.\n\nNegative contributors were Hub Power, Pakistan Petroleum, Engro Fertilisers, Pakistan Tobacco and Mari Petroleum, which lost 110 points, it added.\n\nArif Habib Limited (AHL), in its review, said that it was a \u201cflat day with the market rallying from the low of 66,600 to just below 67,000\u201d.\n\nSome 41 stocks rose while 48 fell with Dawood Hercules (+5.42%), Systems Limited (+2.85%) and Fauji Fertiliser (+0.94%) being the largest contributors to the index gains, it said, adding that according to the World Bank the economic growth in Pakistan was expected to pick up from the current fiscal year but would remain below 3% for the next two years.\n\nJS Global analyst Muhammad Shuja Qureshi said that a volatile session ended with gains of 90 points in the KSE-100 index at 66,886. \u201cGoing forward, investors are advised to accumulate value stocks on dips,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nOverall trading volumes increased to 239.6 million shares against Monday\u2019s tally of 238.8 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs8.9 billion.\n\nShares of 342 companies were traded. Of these, 160 stocks closed higher, 153 dropped and 29 remained unchanged.\n\nWorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 32.3 million shares, gaining Rs0.05 to close at Rs1.35. It was followed by PTCL with 27.1 million shares, losing Rs0.48 to close at Rs16.46 and Pakistan Reinsurance Company with 13.1 million shares, losing Rs0.48 to close at Rs15.46.\n\nForeign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs117.4 million, according to the NCCPL.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 3rd, 2024.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",
