            "text": "watch now\n\nStandard Chartered shares slid Thursday as the bank's big bet on China hit a stumbling block, leading to significant losses in the country. Shares of the Asia-focused bank tanked as much as 17% in early deals in London, sparking a temporary halt in trade. The London-listed stock later closed 12% lower. The U.K.-headquartered bank reported pre-tax profit of $633 million for the third quarter \u2014 a 54% drop from the same period last year. The result was hit by the bank slashing the value of its investment in China Bohai Bank by $697 million. Standard Chartered also announced a credit impairment charge of $294 million \u2014 up $62 million on the year \u2014 including a $186 million charge relating to the China commercial real estate sector.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Standard Chartered shares\n\nStandard Bank Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford on Thursday told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that the \"overall performance of the bank is very strong,\" despite the China news. Halford noted that China's commercial real estate sector \"clearly has been problematic,\" but said that GDP in the country is forecast to bounce back around 5% within the next two to three years. \"What we're seeing is probably a slower recovery post-Covid than in some countries. But it's a huge population to mobilize after such a big event,\" Halford said. \"Most countries would be more than happy to have that kind of growth level,\" Halford said. \"So we are very, very much of the view that this is a period that we need to go through. We'll stick with it [and] as the economy gets going, then that should be good with us and should be good for others.\" China's economic recovery has broadly disappointed since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, although its third-quarter growth came in stronger than expected, boosting hopes that things could be about to turn around.\n\n'A blessing and a curse'",

            "text": "Standard Chartered Plc has committed to returning additional funds to its shareholders while outlining initiatives to enhance returns and streamline operations at the emerging markets-centered bank\n\nWith fourth-quarter profits surpassing analyst predictions, the London-based institution announced plans to initiate a new $1 billion share buyback program. The \"Fit for Growth\" initiative is projected to yield approximately $1.5 billion in expense reductions over the forthcoming three years. However, it is expected to incur a corresponding sum in costs due to the implementation of permanent organizational adjustments.\n\nAlso read: What to do if you have a Paytm UPI handle? RBI advises this\n\nBill Winters, the Chief Executive Officer who has been with the company for nearly nine years, has been actively seeking methods to enhance returns for shareholders and revitalize the stock, which has declined by over 15% in the last year. During a press conference on Friday, he candidly referred to the share price as \"poor,\" emphasizing his commitment to altering the market's perception of the bank.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not happy with the share price at all,\" Winters was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. He further said, \"The market has a sense that it\u2019s hard to get things done at Standard Chartered and this Fit for Growth program is going to tackle that head on.\"\n\nStandard Chartered reported a significant increase in its adjusted pretax profit, soaring by 63% to $1.06 billion for the three months ending in December, surpassing the estimated $989.6 million.\n\nAlso read: Zee Ent forms independent advisory committee headed by ex-HC judge amid negative public opinion\n\nThe bank announced a final dividend of 21 cents per share, marking a 50 percent increase in the full-year payout. Additionally, it revealed new strategic targets, aiming for a 12 percent return on tangible equity by 2026 and anticipating a growth in operating income between 5 percent to 7 percent for the years 2024 to 2026.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg report, Standard Chartered shares have performed poorly in recent months and are almost 40% below the level they were when Winters joined the bank in June 2015, despite its exposure to some of the world\u2019s fastest growing markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nStandard Chartered reported a decrease in profits during the third quarter, attributed to charges linked to investments in China. Similarly, its larger competitor, HSBC Holdings Plc, experienced a profit setback earlier in the week due to impairments on investments in China. The country's weak confidence and an enduring crisis in its real estate market have plagued these investments, affecting the financial performance of both banking giants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken very material provisions there, well ahead of our peers who have investments in Chinese banks,\" Winters told reporters on a media call.\n\nStanChart saw heavy selloff in its shares when it announced its third-quarter earnings as investors reacted to news of fresh charges against Chinese real estate and a $700 million impairment on its stake in China Bohai Bank. The stock tumbled more than 12% on Oct. 26, its biggest loss since August 2012.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s plan to keep costs below $12 billion in 2026 and its revenue\u2019s lowered sensitivity to rate cuts are critical to keeping operating jaws positive and delivering its new guidance of 12% return on tangible equity in two years, some 200-bps above consensus, says the Bloomberg report. A $1 billion buyback and $5 billion total return plan by 2026 is also incrementally positive.\n\n(With inputs from Bloomberg)\n\nMilestone Alert!

            "text": "(AI VIdeo Summary)\n\nNVIDIA tops earnings expectations, and FOMC minutes show rate cuts pushed back\n\nIn this video, Angeline Ong gives an overview of the important events and financial reports that will take place on 23 February. She starts off by mentioning some big news in the trading world, such as NVIDIA's earnings and the FOMC Minutes. These minutes reveal that the Fed is not in a hurry to lower interest rates, which has caused market expectations for a rate cut to be pushed back to June.\n\nImportant market data updates\n\nOng also highlights some economic releases to pay attention to, such as the GFK Consumer Confidence print from the UK and Germany's Q4 GDP growth rate. These figures are important because they give insight into the strength of the economy in those countries.\n\nShe also mentions the EFOL Business Climate Reading, which is of interest because recent PMI numbers suggest that the business climate is improving. This could have an impact on the stock market.\n\nUpdates on oil\n\nAnother thing to watch closely is the Baker Hughes oil rig count. Oil prices are currently affected more by supply than demand, so any changes in the rig count could impact prices. Weak demand from China has been putting pressure on oil prices, so this is something to keep an eye on.\n\nBanks and companies' earnings reports\n\nLastly, Ong discusses some earnings reports. Standard Chartered is set to release its four-year earnings, following other banks like Barclays, Lloyds, and HSBC. Investors have been particularly interested in HSBC's announcement about China. Ong shows a chart of Standard Chartered stock and points out a downward trend, but notes that if it breaks through a certain level of support with higher trading volumes, the downward trend could continue.\n\nShe also talks about Allianz, a company that is releasing its full-year earnings report. Ong shows a chart of Allianz stock and highlights an upward trend line that was broken in October but later recovered. If the stock reaches a third high, it could indicate that the upward trend is still intact.",

            "text": "Goldman Sachs has upgraded its rating on multinational banking group Standard Chartered from 'neutral' to 'buy', saying that upside risk isn't reflected in the current share price.\n\nThe stock currently trades close to record-low valuations, despite a near-decade-high return on tangible equity of 11% next year, and offering a 10% total capital return yield, Goldman said.\n\nMeanwhile, StanChart is set to show a \"rare out-performance relative to its bank peers over the next two years\", according to Goldman.\n\nAnalysts expect the bank to deliver a double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in earnings per share (EPS) and a 2.7 percentage-point improvement in return on equity (ROE), compared with low single-digit EPS CAGR and declining ROE at peer banks.\n\nGoldman said that improvements in EPS and ROE will be driven by four factors: an unwind of loss-making hedges put-on by the group during late 2021, starting in February 24; a better outlook for non-funds income; a new chief financial officer to be appointed next year who could focus on the outsized corporate office function relative to its peers; and the possibility for continued buyback with capital now at the top-end of the target range.\n\nThird-quarter results from StanChart last month came in about 10% below consensus forecasts on a pre-tax profit level. \"We expect 4Q23 results delivery to be cleaner, in-line with expectations, and to be further supported by a c.US$750mn buy-back announcement. The stock tends to react to earnings and can rise into a potential buy-back,\" Goldman said.\n\nGoldman cut its target price for the shares from 879p to 868p.\n\nThe stock was up 0.8% at 665.2p by 1008 GMT.",

            "text": "The lender, one of Hong Kong\u2019s three currency-issuing banks, announced a fresh share buy-back of US$1 billion and said it had paid 27 US cents as dividend in the full year in 2023, 50 per cent higher than 18 US cents per share a year ago.\n\nThe emerging-markets focused lender posted a net profit of US$3.47billion in 2023, or US$1.08 per share, against a profit of US$2.95 billion posted a year ago. This is better than analysts\u2019 estimate of US$3.34 billion.\n\nStandard Chartered, reiterated its positive view on Hong Kong, the lender\u2019s single largest market, after it reported an 18 per cent jump in profit for 2023, beating street estimates as its bottom line was driven by higher interest income and a wealth management boom.\n\nThe London-based bank, which generates much of its revenues from Asia, reported US$5.09 billion in statutory pre-tax profit for 2023, up 19 per cent from US$4.28 billion in 2022, missing the US$5.39 billion estimate made by analysts in a Bloomberg poll.\n\nExterior of the Standard Chartered Exchange Square Branch in Central. Photo: Jonathan Wong\n\nUnderlying pre-tax profit in Hong Kong, its single largest market, rose 77 per cent to US$1.85 billion, a strong performance that Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters said showed the city\u2019s potential.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, Hong Kong\u2019s record income, super growth, outstanding franchise, and huge connector role between mainland China and the rest of the world is what makes Hong Kong the heart of our business,\u201d he said when asked about a recent opinion piece by former Morgan Stanley chief economist Stephen Roach titled \u201cIt pains me to say Hong Kong is over\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is a business as strong as it has ever been,\u201d said Winters while adding the internationalisation of the Chinese currency yuan, the development of the Greater Bay Area and the expansion of wealth management businesses will drive the city forward.\n\n\u201cClearly one of the areas of strength has been the wealth management products in Hong Kong, and also Singapore,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe wealth trends in Asia are inexorable. They are very strong and we can look forward to high single digits, low double-digit growth in underlying wealth, and Hong Kong has been and will continue to be at the centre of that. Singapore, of course, is also doing quite well.\u201d\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s Hong Kong CEO Mary Huen Wai-yi said an expected cut in interest rates this year will help boost loan growth.\n\n\u201cIn general, when the interest rate goes lower, demand for loans and wealth management products increases,\u201d she said in a media briefing in Hong Kong on Friday afternoon.\n\nWinters said the bank will continue to actively manage the group\u2019s capital position with a target to return at least US$5 billion to shareholders over the next three years.\n\nStandard Chartered set aside an aggregate US$1.2 billion towards credit impairment charges related to its exposure in China\u2019s commercial real estate sector, over the past three years.\n\n\u201cWe are very well provided for it right now,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2023, the situation appeared to be less gloomy with credit impairment charges related to its China commercial real estate business falling to US$282 million from US$582 million in 2022. This reduced the bank\u2019s overall bad debt charges by 37 per cent year on year to US$528 million in 2023.\n\nFor the fourth quarter alone, Standard Chartered reported that its underlying pre-tax profit rose 74 per cent to US$1.1 billion.\n\nShares of Standard Chartered rose 3.7 per cent on Friday to close at HK$62.45 after the result announcement at Friday lunch break, its highest since November.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s performance was also hit by an impairment charge related to its investment in China Bohai Bank, which reduced the carrying value of its investment by US$850 million. It is one the founding shareholders of the Tianjin-based joint-stock commercial bank set up in 2006.\n\nOn Wednesday, HSBC reported its pre-tax profit for the fourth quarter dropped 80 per cent to US$1 billion, mainly due to a US$3 billion impairment charge on its 19.03 per cent stake in mainland lender Bank of Communications, caused by a reduction in its carrying value of investments.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s Asia business, which provides most of its revenues and profitability, made an underlying pre-tax profit of US$4.74 billion in 2023, an increase of 32 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nThe lender\u2019s Africa and Middle East profit rose 90 per cent to US$1.31 billion during the same period under review.\n\nIn contrast, the bank\u2019s Europe and America operations reported a loss of US$330 million in 2023, compared with a gain of US$834 million in 2022.\n\nIts net interest margin, an important measure of a bank\u2019s profitability, rose to 1.67 per cent in 2023, from 1.41 per cent a year earlier.\n\nA widened margin helped boost Standard Chartered\u2019s net interest income by 23 per cent to US$9.6 billion. Operating income, the equivalent of revenue in US accounting terms, rose 10 per cent to US$17.4 billion in 2023 at constant currency exchange rate.\n\nAnother key unit, the consumer, private banking and wealth management business, saw a 60 per cent profit growth during the year under review. The lender has rolled out a swathe of wealth management centres in recent years to tap the investment demand of the wealthy. Its corporate banking profit also increased 42 per cent last year.\n\nProfits were offset by losses in its new digital banking business. Its SC Ventures business losses widened by 12 per cent year on year to underlying pre-tax loss of US$408 million in 2023. The segment includes majority owned virtual banks, Mox in Hong Kong and Trust in Singapore.",

            "text": "We wouldn't blame Standard Chartered PLC ( ) shareholders if they were a little worried about the fact that Simon Cooper, a company insider, recently netted about UK\u00a39.6m selling shares at an average price of UK\u00a36.50. Probably the most concerning element of the whole transaction is that the disposal amounted to 98% of their entire holding.\n\nStandard Chartered Insider Transactions Over The Last Year\n\nIn fact, the recent sale by Simon Cooper was the biggest sale of Standard Chartered shares made by an insider individual in the last twelve months, according to our records. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of UK\u00a36.54. We generally consider it a negative if insiders have been selling, especially if they did so below the current price, because it implies that they considered a lower price to be reasonable. While insider selling is not a positive sign, we can't be sure if it does mean insiders think the shares are fully valued, so it's only a weak sign. It is worth noting that this sale was 98% of Simon Cooper's holding.\n\nOver the last year, we can see that insiders have bought 406.14k shares worth UK\u00a32.7m. But they sold 1.61m shares for UK\u00a311m. Over the last year we saw more insider selling of Standard Chartered shares, than buying. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you click on the chart, you can see all the individual transactions, including the share price, individual, and the date!\n\nIf you are like me, then you will not want to miss this free\n\nInsider Ownership Of Standard Chartered\n\nI like to look at how many shares insiders own in a company, to help inform my view of how aligned they are with insiders. We usually like to see fairly high levels of insider ownership. It appears that Standard Chartered insiders own 0.2% of the company, worth about UK\u00a339m. We've certainly seen higher levels of insider ownership elsewhere, but these holdings are enough to suggest alignment between insiders and the other shareholders.\n\nWhat Might The Insider Transactions At Standard Chartered Tell Us?\n\nUnfortunately, there has been more insider selling of Standard Chartered stock, than buying, in the last three months. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. On the plus side, Standard Chartered makes money, and is growing profits. While insiders do own shares, they don't own a heap, and they have been selling. So we'd only buy after careful consideration. So these insider transactions can help us build a thesis about the stock, but it's also worthwhile knowing the risks facing this company. For example - Standard Chartered has we think you should be aware of.\n\nOf course Standard Chartered may not be the best stock to buy. So you may wish to see this free\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nValuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

            "text": "Standard Chartered Plc pledged to hand back more money to shareholders as it outlined efforts to improve returns and reduce complexity at the emerging markets-focused lender.\n\nReporting fourth-quarter profits that beat analyst estimates, the London-headquartered bank said it would kick off a fresh $1 billion buyback. The firm said a new \"Fit for Growth\" program will save about $1.5 billion in expenses over the next three years, but also add a similar amount to costs for the permanent organizational changes.\n\nChief Executive Officer Bill Winters, who joined the group almost nine years ago, has been looking for ways to bolster returns for investors and galvanize the stock, which has sunk more than 15 per cent in the past year.\n\n\"We're not happy with the share price at all,\" Winters said on Bloomberg Television. The market has \"a sense that it's hard to get things done at Standard Chartered and this Fit for Growth program is going to tackle that head on.\"\n\nFinal dividend\n\nStandard Chartered's adjusted pretax profit rose 63 per cent to $1.06 billion in the three months through December, beating an estimate of $989.6 million.\n\nThe lender declared a final dividend of 21 cents a share, raising the full-year payout by 50 per cent. It unveiled new guidance, targeting a 12 per cent return on tangible equity in 2026 and a 5 to 7 per cent growth in operating income for 2024 to 2026.\n\nShares jumped as much as 6.9 per cent in early London trading on Friday.\n\nOptions\n\nDespite its exposure to some of the world's fastest growing markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, Standard Chartered shares have performed poorly in recent months and are almost 40 per cent below the level they were when Winters joined the bank in June 2015.\n\nThe bank is weighing restructuring its institutional banking arm, the unit that houses the firm's investment bankers and traders, Bloomberg News reported earlier. Options include separating its investment bank from its corporate and commercial banking operations, according to people familiar with the matter. The move could lead to job cuts and is one of several possibilities being weighed with no final decisions made yet, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing matters still under consideration.\n\n\"We've taken very material provisions there, well ahead of our peers who have investments in Chinese banks,\" Winters told reporters on a media call.",

            "text": "(AI Video Summary)\n\nStandard Chartered share price on positive rise\n\nStandard Chartered, a bank, had a really good day in the stock market. Its shares went up by more than 9% in just one day. The bank reported making a lot more money before taxes, and they expect their income to grow even more in the next few years. They even announced a plan to buy back some of their shares, which investors are really happy about.\n\nTechnical analysis of outlook\n\nTo understand what's happening with the stock, people are looking at the technical analysis. This is where they look at charts and indicators to try to predict what will happen next. The chart for Standard Chartered shows a green candle, which means the stock is going up. It's also getting close to the 200-day moving average, which is another positive sign. But there's the Relative Strength Index (RSI) that suggests the stock might be getting too expensive. The RSI is above 70, which means the stock might be overvalued.\n\nKeep in mind that an RSI reading of 50 means the stock is normal, and anything above 70 means it's overpriced. Right now, the RSI for Standard Chartered shows it's overpriced.\n\nSo, in summary, Standard Chartered is doing really well. They're making more money and even buying back some shares. Because of this, the stock price has gone up a lot. But, when looking at the technical analysis, there are concerns that the stock might be too expensive.",

            "text": "Standard Chartered on Thursday said its pre-tax profit dropped 33% in the third quarter ended September 30, due to a nearly $1 billion combined hit from its exposure to China's real estate and banking sectors.\n\nThe Asia-focused British bank reported a $700 million impairment from its stake in China Bohai Bank, and a $186 million charge from Chinese commercial real estate.\n\nShares of Standard Chartered tumbled as much as 12% in London, the biggest intraday loss since August 2012.\n\nThe UK-headquartered bank reported July-September statutory pretax profit at $633 million, as compared with $996 million a year earlier.\n\nIts income rose 6% at $4.4 billion on rising global interest rates.\n\nStanChart said that the hit on its 16% stake in China Bohai, in which it invested more than a decade ago, was due to lower forecast interest rates and decreased lending margins.\n\nAt the end of September, StanChart's Chinese real estate exposure totalled at $2.7 billion, down $200 million from the previous quarter.\n\nChina Bohai Bank had reported a 17.8% fall in January-June net interest income, leading to a nearly 7% fall in its overall profit.\n\n\u201cWe took a couple of impairment charges a year and a bit ago, and we have taken the extra impairment charge as you can see today,\" said Standard Chartered chief financial officer (CFO) Andy Halford.\n\n\u201cThat is reflective of the fact that particularly its own net interest margin has been weaker,\" he added.\n\nThe bank also said that it is confident of hitting its return-on-tangible-equity targets of 10% this year and 11% in 2024. Its net interest margin will now approach 1.7 percentage points rather than be around that level.\n\nIncome from transaction banking - the bulk in cash management services \u2013 rose 42% and retail products grew 17%.\n\nFor the financial markets trading business, income dropped 8%.\n\nStandard Chartered is planning to hand back more than $5 billion to investors and in July had announced a $1 billion buyback.\n\nMilestone Alert!
