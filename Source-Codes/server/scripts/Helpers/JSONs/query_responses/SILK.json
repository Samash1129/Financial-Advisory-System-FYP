            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has sought clarification from 19 companies to explain the unusual movements in their share prices and volumes. The PSX issued notices to these companies on December 20, 2023, seeking clarification on this unexpected fluctuation.\n\nAccording to the PSX data, the share prices and volumes of these companies showed significant variations between November 16, 2023 and December 15, 2023.\n\nAmong the companies that have received notices from the PSX are two banks, namely The Bank of Punjab and Samba Bank Limited.\n\nOther firms that are also under scrutiny include First Punjab Modaraba, Unicap Modaraba, Sapphire Fibres Limited, Reliance Insurance Company Limited, Pakistan National Shipping Corporation Limited, Pak-Gulf Leasing Company Limited, Pak Elektron Limited, Otsuka Pakistan Limited, The National Silk & Rayon Mills Limited, K-Electric Limited, Universal Network Systems Limited, First Treet Manufacturing Modaraba, First Habib Modaraba, Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited, First Elite Capital Modaraba, Chakwal Spinning Mills Limited, and Agritech Limited.\n\nThe PSX has requested these companies to provide any material or price-sensitive information that is likely to affect the price of their shares if it is not already available to the public as stipulated under the PSX Regulation.\n\nThe stock exchange stated that this development underscores the vigilance and regulatory oversight exercised by the PSX aimed at ensuring that all market participants operate within a framework defined by transparency and integrity.\n\nThe market analysts are speculating that the unusual movement in the share prices and volumes of these companies could be due to the rumors of possible mergers, acquisitions, expansions, or other strategic decisions by these companies or their competitors.\n\nThe PSX has warned that if any of the companies fail to comply with the PSX Regulation, they may face disciplinary action as per the PSX Rules.\n\nFollowing the PSX letter, Sapphire Fibres Limited, Samba Bank, Pakistan National Shipping Corporation, GEMUNSL, First Punjab Modaraba and Agritech Limited said on December 21 that they did not know of any cause/ significant information that could have led to the abnormal change in market price or volume during the specified time period.",

            "short_description": "Here's What Happened in Pakistan's Banking Sector in 2023  ProPakistani",
            "text": "The banking sector in Pakistan maintained robust growth in profitability during 2023, including growth in assets and deposits, the high-interest rate regime allowed them to make handsome margins, increase investment in securities, and lend cash to the federal government at exorbitant financing rates.\n\nOn the other hand, they attracted deposits from customers, providing them with handsome returns too. There have also been major transformations and developments in a few commercial banks, which will impact the banking sector positively in the long term.\n\nALSO READ Bank Alfalah Launches Pakistan\u2019s First Digital Payments Sales and Service Centers Focusing on Merchants and Small Businesses\n\nSome of the initiatives taken by different commercial banks will be followed by other competing banks in the near future. Below are a few major developments that happened during 2023:\n\n(1) Faysal Bank\u2019s Conversion to Islamic Bank\n\nFaysal Bank announced its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank on the first day of the calendar year. The bank converted its assets, deposits, operations, branches, and licenses from conventional to Sharia-based banks and became the second-biggest Islamic bank in the banking industry.\n\nThis transition is said to be the biggest conversion of any conventional bank, not only in Pakistan but in the world, considering the size of the operation. The transformation of Faysal Bank also provided a roadmap for other banks seeking to convert their operations from conventional to Islamic.\n\n(2) MCB Bank Acquires 81% Stake in Asset Management Company\n\nMCB Bank acquired an additional 30 percent stake in its subsidiary, MCBAH Savings and Investments, at the cost of Rs. 649 million. Through this deal, the bank received 21.6 million shares, or 30 percent, of another sponsor, Arif Habib Corporation, at a share price of Rs. 30. Hence, its overall shareholding in the subsidiary increased to over 81 percent from 51 percent.\n\nMCB-AH Limited is one of the leading asset management companies in the fund management sector, and a few companies within a sector are also listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The transition in shareholding will strengthen the position of the bank in the financial sector.\n\n(3) JS Bank Acquires Major Shareholding in BankIslami\n\nJS Bank Acquired major shares in BankIslami to convert the Islamic bank into its subsidiary with ownership of the significant shareholding. The bank increased its stakes in the Islamic bank by 75 percent by purchasing shares from the parent financial entity, JS Group.\n\nThe share swap deal was successful between the sponsors of the Islamic bank, despite being challenged in the Sindh High Court. JS Bank maintained a different strategic position, which will increase its profitability and influence in the banking industry after this deal.\n\n(4) Prominent Banks Plan for Conversion to Islamic Banking\n\nProminent conventional banks with a separate division of Islamic banking announced their plans for full-fledged conversion to Islamic Banking in light of a verdict issued by the Federal Shariat Court last year.\n\nThe banks included the Bank of Punjab, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, and Summit Bank. In this regard, the Bank of Punjab hired a consultant, and Summit Bank rebranded itself as Mukramah Bank. This transition in banking operations will likely attract different conventional banks to follow the same suit.\n\nALSO READ Financial Irregularities Worth Rs.14 Billion Allegedly Uncovered During PSL Audit\n\n(5) Bank Alfalah Acquires Stakes in QistBazaar\n\nBank Alfalah acquired 7.2 percent stakes in BNPL QistBazaar at a cost of Rs. 140 million. The deal can be a win-win situation for both entities in scaling up their business and profitability.\n\nIn addition to the equity agreement, Bank Alfalah, and QistBazaar signed an embedded financing agreement in Shariah-compliant mode for up to Rs. 350 million. Accordingly, the bank will incorporate digital financing products within the QistBazaar platform to offer embedded consumer durables financing in BNPL\u2019s mode.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s move to invest in QistBazaar can prove a stepping stone to strengthening the fintech landscape of the country, as more banks are likely to follow suit for collaboration and investment in fintech companies, which is the need of the hour.\n\n(6) Major Banks to Set up Exchange Companies\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) plans to streamline the business of foreign exchange across the country with control and regulation on trade and flows of foreign currencies, mainly to monitor the stability of the rupee against the dollar. In this regard, the banking industry watched as various exchange companies in Category B shut down while commercial banks were allowed to establish their foreign exchange subsidiaries as an alternate option in the financial sector.\n\nAn overwhelming number of banks made announcements to set up subsidiaries of foreign exchange, including HBL, UBL, MCB, Bank Al Habib, Meezan Bank, Habib Metro Bank, Askari Bank, etc.\n\n(7) Summit Bank Receives Investment from UAE\n\nSummit Bank received a significant capital injection of Rs. 10 billion from its sponsor and prominent UAE investor, Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah.\n\nThe investor subscribed to 3.98 billion new shares of the bank at Rs. 2.51 per share, becoming the major shareholder in the bank. Moreover, Summit Bank plans to convert its entire operation from a conventional banking system to an Islamic one, similar to Faysal Bank. Its board of directors also approved a three-year conversion plan, and the bank has been renamed Bank Makramah Limited\n\n(8) Silk Bank Attracts Investors\n\nSilk Bank, once again, sought the financial support of a strong investor on a long-term basis to fulfill its regulatory requirements of paid-up capital and the sustainability of its profitable operations.\n\nThe bank has attracted interest from MCB Bank, United Bank Limited, International Commercial Bank of South Sudan, and Pakistan Housing Finance Company for investment and merger. At present, these financial institutions are carrying out the due diligence of the bank, which is showing the increasing competition among these entities in striking a deal with Silk Bank.\n\nSudanese Bank and Pakistan Housing Company even expressed their investment plans of 50 million euros and Rs. 12 billion, respectively. With four proposals in hand, it is a good time for Silk Bank to say yes to at least one institution with remarkable experience in local industry and operating a subsidiary.\n\nALSO READ State Bank Fails to Satisfy Panel in Rs. 70 Billion Money Laundering Scandal\n\n(9) Meezan Bank Collaborates to Launch Islamic Microfinance Services\n\nMeezan Bank took the initiative to collaborate with SAFCO Microfinance Company Private Limited (SMCL) for the launch of Islamic microfinance services in the low-income segment of society.\n\nThis is the first time that a commercial bank has significantly supported a microfinance institution. The leading Islamic bank has committed to providing Rs. 100 million in financing and technical support for product development, capacity building, and training for the microfinance company.\n\nThe step will further accelerate the penetration of Islamic banking across the country. The microfinance company established its inaugural Islamic microfinance branch under the brand name \u2018Yaqeen\u2019 in Hyderabad, Pakistan.\n\n(10) HBL to Set Up a Specialized Agri Subsidiary\n\nHabib Bank Limited received approval from the State Bank of Pakistan to set up a specialized subsidiary for the agriculture sector. The subsidiary will work to provide financial access to farmers and other players in the agriculture sector, particularly, but the institution has plans to be deeply involved in the sector\u2019s development.\n\nThe leading bank previously carried out different projects successfully in this sector, which gave it the confidence to enhance its footprints in the food sector with a much bigger role and a long-term profitable engagement. The out-of-box approach of the bank\u2019s leadership might give it a competitive edge in the industry.",

            "text": "Buy or sell stocks for today: On account of sharp selling in small and mid-cap stocks, the Indian stock market opened lower on Thursday. However, bulls came back strongly in the last session and most of the Indian sectors witnessed sharp buying, which helped Dalal Street recuperate its losses and end higher. Except for the Bank Nifty index, all sectors ended in the green zone with IT and auto being the outperformers.\n\nThe Nifty 50 index finished 162 points higher at the 22,217 level, the BSE Sensex gained 535 points and closed at the 73,158 mark while the Bank Nifty index ended 99 points lower at the 46,919 level. In the broad market, the mid-cap index outperformed the Nifty 50 index even as the advance-decline ratio improved to 1.22:1.\n\nAlso Read: Bosch, Bharat Forge, National Aluminium, Sun TV among 21 stocks to trade ex-dividend today\n\nGlobal stocks rallied, with Japan\u2019s benchmark hitting a record high and Europe\u2019s on track to do the same after Nvidia\u2019s blowout sales forecast reinforced investor conviction in the boom in generative AI use.\n\nIntraday trading tips for Friday\n\nVaishali Parekh, Vice President \u2014 Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher believes that the Indian stock market mood has turned positive after the strong rebound on Thursday's session. The Prabhudas Lilladher expert said that the Nifty 50 index is now heading for its immediate targets placed at 22,400 and 22,800 levels.\n\nAlso Read: Stock market today: SAIL, Biocon, ZEEL among 15 stocks under F&O ban list today\n\nOn stocks to buy today, Vaishali Parekh recommended three intraday stocks for today \u2014 HCL Technologies, Coal India Ltd, and National Aluminium Company or NALCO.\n\nStock market today\n\nOn the outlook for the Nifty 50 today, Vaishali Parekh said, \"Nifty 50 index witnessed a slightly weak morning session but taking support from 21,880 zones, it witnessed a strong pullback to erase the loss and a decisive breach above 22,000 zones, further strengthened the bias to record the All-Time High level of 22,252 during the intraday session. With sentiment maintained positive, we anticipate the index to achieve the next targets of 22,400 and 22,800 levels, respectively in the coming days.\"\n\n\"Bank Nifty witnessed a decent revival from the 46,400 zone but resisted near the 47,000 levels to end lower near the 46,900 zone and has been underperforming as compared to the Nifty index. The index would have the important support of 50EMA level near the 46,200 zone and would need a decisive breach above 47,400 levels to improve the bias,\" said Parekh.\n\nParekh went on to add that the immediate support for Nifty today is placed at the 22,100 level, while the resistance is seen at the 22,400 mark. Bank Nifty would have a daily range of 46,600 to 47,500 levels.\n\nStocks to buy today\n\n1] HCL Technologies: Buy at \u20b91686.40, target \u20b91755, stop loss \u20b91650;\n\n2] Coal India: Buy at \u20b9445.15, target \u20b9467, stop loss \u20b9435; and\n\n3] NALCO: Buy at \u20b9161.60, target \u20b9173, stop loss \u20b9157.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of individual analysts, experts, and broking companies, not of Mint.

            "text": "Samvat 2079 has been an eventful year in more than one ways as the key benchmark indices showed tremendous resilience and scaled fresh life-time highs despite multiple headwinds in the form of high interest rates, rising bond yields, volatile crude oil prices, the Middle-East crisis and India-Canada spat.\n\nFor the records, the S&P BSE Sensex hit an all-time high at 67,927 in September, and the Nifty registered a summit at 20,222. Even as the indices are on course to close Samvat 2079 off the record highs, they still hold strong gains of up to 10 per cent and 16 per cent on the Sensex and Nifty, respectively. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel\n\nGoing ahead, the outlook for Samvat 2080 looks promising with India\u2019s economic growth projected to be higher, prospects of sturdy corporate earnings and hopes of a downturn in interest rate cycle. However, the markets may exhibit higher volatility in the year ahead owing to general elections scheduled in 2024.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, here\u2019s a list of top stock picks by select brokerages for Samvat 2080.\n\nNirmal Bang\n\n\n\nArchean Chemical Industries\n\nReco Price: Rs 550\n\nTarget: Rs 767\n\nUpside Potential: 39%\n\nDuring H1FY24, global headwinds in chemical industry led to downward pricing pressure on bromine. However, demand remained strong and many customers liquidated large part of their inventory. Thus, one can expect a good quarter with demand revival in the medium-term. Archean has delivered revenue growth of 39.5 per cent CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate) and improved EBITDA margin from 35 per cent in FY21 to 44 per cent in FY23. EBITDA margin guidance remained in the range of 37 per cent \u2013 42 per cent in the medium-term. Our earnings forecast have been revised considering the expected weak performance for FY24E due to challenges faced by the overall industry.\n\nFive Star Business Finance\n\nReco Price: Rs 740\n\nTarget: Rs 1,100\n\nUpside Potential: 49%\n\nFive Star\u2019s strong return metrics (RoA/RoE of 8 per cent/ 18 per cent in FY25E) and high earnings growth of 30 per cent CAGR over FY23-25E shall be driven by strong AUM CAGR of 35 per cent; stable NIM and cost/ income; and subdued credit cost in the 0.6 per cent \u2013 0.8 per cent range. The target price is based on 25x Sep 2025 EPS at 0.7x PE/ G (assuming FY23-26E earnings CAGR of 35 per cent).\n\nFusion Micro Finance\n\nReco Price: Rs 603\n\nTarget: Rs 820\n\nUpside Potential: 36%\n\nGood corporate governance having auditors from big 4 since inception; Warbug/ Creation stakes at 39 per cent/ 24 per cent. Fusion has been delivering industry leading metrics, identical to CreditAccess which is considered as the best in class MFI. On a conservative basis and due to limited listing history, we value Fusion at a 30 per cent discount to CreditAccess at 2.1x Sep 2025 BV.\n\nSai Silks (Kalamandir)\n\nReco Price: Rs 236\n\nTarget: Rs 323\n\nUpside Potential: 37%\n\nThe organised apparel retail is expected to grow at CAGR of around 19.9 per cent over FY20 \u2013 27. Other than this, south India is the top contributor to the saree market in India, accounting for 50 per cent of total saree sales in FY22. The organised saree market valued at Rs 11,369 crore is expected to reach Rs 39,324 crore by FY27. The company is among the top 10 retailers in south India. With growth and margins coming back, we feel stock is available at attractive valuation and is trading at EV/ EBITDA of 10.7x FY25E EBITDA.\n\nVishnu Prakash R Pungalia (VPRP)\n\nReco Price: Rs 186\n\nTarget: Rs 262\n\nUpside Potential: 41%\n\nVPRP is Rajasthan-based EPC company with focus on water supply projects. The company\u2019s order book and revenue grew at a CAGR of around 50 per cent over FY21-23, while PAT grew at over 100 per cent. The company seems like a small fish in a big point - with revenue of just above Rs 1,000 crore, and total addressable market stands at Rs 6 lakh crore. The low revenue base and demonstrated track record of high growth with margin expansion makes the company attractive compared to listed peers.\n\nAnand Rathi\n\n\n\nIDFC First Bank\n\nReco Price: Rs 83\n\nTarget: Rs 114\n\nUpside Potential: 37%\n\nIDFC First Bank has undergone the first phase of its transformation from an infra financier to a granular retail lending bank. Investment in technology and building a scalable liability franchisee would keep costs high in the near term, despite strong granular loan growth. The bank expects the credit card business to breakeven by FY25. 24 - 25 per cent of the credit card mix are revolvers. The bank expects to reach 13 -15 per cent ROE by FY25 and 1.4 - 1.6 per cent ROA by FY25.\n\nSyrma SGS Technology\n\nReco Price: Rs 612\n\nTarget: Rs 735\n\nUpside Potential: 20%\n\nThe company has a total order book of approximately Rs 3,500 crore, with Rs 2,200 \u2013 Rs 2,300 crore expected to be delivered in the next 12 months. The company has done a capex of Rs 50 crore in Q1FY24 and plans to spend Rs 200 \u2013 Rs 250 crore in total of the year. The company can be a key player in the growing ESDM industry (especially in the ODM segment) if it grabs the opportunities available across end-user industries and executes well on the burgeoning order inflows.\n\nMTAR Technologies\n\nReco Price: Rs 2,471\n\nTarget: Rs 2,970\n\nUpside Potential: 20%\n\nThe company is expanding its product range, including valves and semi-cryogenic engines in the defence and space sectors. MTAR expects to secure defense contracts shortly, enabling direct supply to major OEMs and the Ministy of Defence. They are also considering new facilities in Europe and the US to enhance their supply chain and competitiveness. Their electrical and harness system is undergoing certification and is expected to qualify by Q2FY24.\n\nMahindra & Mahindra (M&M)\n\nReco Price: Rs 1,497\n\nTarget: Rs 1,770\n\nUpside Potential: 18%\n\nM&M has been the dominant market leader in the domestic tractor market, commanding a market share of 42.9 per cent in Q1FY24 (41.2 per cent in FY23). With its offerings across different brands of Mahindra, Swaraj, Trakstar and soon to be launched Oja and its well-entrenched sales and service network, it is expected to maintain its leadership position going forward as well. The introduction of new range of OJA tractors is expected to boost its topline in the future.\n\nDLF\n\nReco Price: Rs 554\n\nTarget: Rs 640\n\nUpside Potential: 16%\n\nThe company is re-entering Mumbai with a slum redevelopment project in Andheri West. This project is a joint venture with the Trident Group, with DLF investing Rs 400 crore for a 51 per cent stake. The planned development spans 3 - 3.5 msf, with the first 0.9 msf to be launched within 12 months. For FY24, management expects pre-sales to surpass Rs 12,000 crore, driven by significant inventory, upcoming launches, and strong demand. They plan to introduce msf of projects valued at Rs 19,700 crore, with the majority in Gurugram along with projects in Chennai, Chandigarh and Noida.\n\nSharekhan\n\nBank of India\n\nReco Price: Rs 103\n\nThe management has guided for a strong cash recoveries amounting to Rs 12,000 crore in FY24 vs Rs 7,233 crore in FY23 which would result in recoveries outpacing slippages in FY24 driven by resolution of some of the accounts under NCLT led by the power sector and OTS (One Time Settlement). We believe valuations are expected to inch higher as return ratio improves in the coming quarters on the back of uptick in loan growth, stable margins, further lower credit cost.\n\nBirlasoft\n\nReco Price: Rs 550\n\nUnder a new CEO, the company has hired leaders with renewed focus on select geographies, verticals, and service lines. The strategic efforts continue to pay off as evident from consecutive quarters of strong revenue growth despite macro-economic overhang. The company\u2019s deal pipeline remains healthy and outlook remains optimistic as management seeks to achieve $200 million of signings every quarter. Further, their renewed focus on key sectors such as BFSI and manufacturing verticals is expected to drive the overall performance of the company.\n\nHindustan Aeronautics (HAL)\n\nReco Price: Rs 1,954\n\nHAL is one of the key beneficiaries of structural reforms in the defence sector. The company\u2019s impending deal with GE and potential export tie-up with countries like Argentina can provide strong long-term growth opportunities. HAL has guided for order inflows of Rs 48,000 crore. Additionally, the company is expected to get R&O orders of around Rs 18,000 crore p.a. There are a few more orders wherein RFPs are likely to be floated and cost of these orders is expected to be around Rs 36,000 crore. It has healthy order book having more than three years of revenue visibility.\n\nKirloskar Oil Engines (KOEL)\n\nReco Price: Rs 557\n\nKOEL is seeing strong demand for retrofit dual fuel kits and emission-control devices in CPCB \u2013 II gensets (post deadline extension for the implementation of CPCB IV+ norms to July 2024). Moreover, demand for CPCB-IV plus gensets is expected to pace up in H2FY24. The company is a leading player in the back-up power market and has a healthy balance sheet and a lean working capital cycle. We build in a Revenue/PAT CAGR of 9 per cent/ 18 per cent (FY23-FY25E).\n\nLarsen & Toubro (L&T)\n\nReco Price: Rs 3,052\n\nL&T\u2019s order book stands at an all-time high of around Rs 4.1 lakh crore (2.1xTTM revenue). L&T has 12-15 per cent revenue and 10-12 per cent order intake growth guidance for FY24. Core business OPM is expected to be at around 9 per cent (up 40/ 50bps y-o-y). Working capital/ sales to be at 16-18 per cent. The company sees ample opportunities in the middle east region in hydrocarbon and renewables. The capex is large in this region and therefore all players would get a fair share of the pie. The company expects Rs 19,000-20,000 crore of orders to be awarded in the defence segment in the near to medium term. L&T remains at the forefront to reap benefits from the AtmaNirbhar Bharat scheme with its diversified businesses across sectors such as defence, infrastructure, heavy engineering and IT and is the best proxy for domestic capex.\n\nAxis Securities\n\nTVS Motors\n\nReco Price: Rs 1,569\n\nTarget: Rs 2,100\n\nUpside Potential: 34%\n\nWe continue to like TVS Motors considering its strong focus on the EV product pipeline ahead of incumbent 2W OEMs, product premiumisation in the ICE category, and growth in export markets. Being well-placed among listed players, we expect the company\u2019s Revenue/ EBITDA/ PAT to grow by around 16 per cent/ 21 per cent/ 23 per cent CAGR over FY24E-26E. FY24/ FY25 to be critical for the company as it executes its EV strategy for the domestic and export markets. We recommend a BUY rating on the stock, valuing it at a sustainable premium P/E multiple of 30x on Dec\u201925 core EPS, other investments at 1x P/BV, and TVS Credit Services at 2X P/BV.\n\nBharti Airtel\n\nReco Price: Rs 924\n\nTarget: Rs 1,155\n\nUpside Potential: 25%\n\nBharti Airtel has the leading ARPU in the industry. The management expects ARPU to improve from the current level of Rs 203, due to a richer customer mix, to Rs 300 going ahead. The company's business fundamentals remain strong and continue to improve. The management foresees huge potential for continued strong revenue and profit growth, supported by expanding distribution in rural areas, investments in the network, and increasing 4G coverage. Furthermore, strategic investment opportunities are available in tower sales, minority, and IPO investments in mobile money, among others. The company's digital portfolio is gaining momentum along with market share gains. The management is confident of gaining industry-leading growth backed by strong rural penetration and a better service portfolio.\n\nHDFC Bank\n\nReco Price: Rs 1,476\n\nTarget: Rs 1,800\n\nUpside Potential: 22%\n\nA key concern for the merged entity was the pressure on margins, which was visible in Q2FY24. A sharp margin compression was owing to the higher cost borrowing of erstwhile HDFC Ltd, ICRR (impact to be visible only in Q2FY24) and excess liquidity that the merged entity continues to carry. Going forward, NIM improvement will be led by (1) Substituting high-cost debt with deposits, (2) Skewing the portfolio mix towards retail loans and (3) Releasing excess liquidity. While near-term margins will continue to face headwinds, we expect recovery from FY25E onwards. NIMs are likely to gravitate to around 4 per cent over FY25-26E. We remain confident in the bank\u2019s ability to sustain its growth momentum given the enormous opportunity post the merger in terms of a larger customer base, larger distribution network, and higher cross-sell opportunities to existing customers of HDFC Ltd. Moreover, we believe the current valuations, too, are reasonable and below the long-term average.\n\nJyothy Labs\n\nReco Price: Rs 358\n\nTarget: Rs 440\n\nUpside Potential: 23%\n\nWe expect the company to deliver healthy Revenue/ EBITDA/ PAT growth of 13 per cent/ 25 per cent/ 25 per cent CAGR over FY23-26E respectively which will elevate the company\u2019s overall return profile. We expect its ROE to increase from 15 per cent in FY23 to 21 per cent in FY26. At CMP, the company is currently trading at 32x/ 29x its FY25/ 26 EPS and with a better earnings growth visibility and return profile, the stock appears attractive in the Small to Midcap Consumer space.\n\nSBI Life Insurance\n\nReco Price: Rs 1,345\n\nTarget: Rs 1,535\n\nUpside Potential: 14%\n\nSBI Life continues to maintain its leadership position with the best in the industry cost ratios. The company has been able to deliver strong APE growth over the past years and we expect the momentum to continue with a more balanced product mix. The company\u2019s channel productivity continues to improve and the focus on improving productivity in the agency channel should yield results in the coming quarters. The company remains confident of achieving around 20 per cent APE growth in FY24 as against the growth of 17 per cent in H1FY24. We expect APE growth to remain strong at around 17-18 per cent over the medium term.",

            "text": "1/10 SRF: Owing to the company\u2019s diverse business segments, strong operating efficiencies with a low working capital cycle, and a broad distribution network that can drive wallet share gains, the analyst report is bullish on SRF Ltd.\u2019s stock. The SOTP (Sum of the Parts) valuation points to a target price of 2,637 per share, implying a 21 percent upside from the current market price of Rs 2182, making this an attractive opportunity for investors.\n\n2/10 Archean Specialty Chemicals Ltd (ACIL): The brokerage firm sees the stock arriving at a target price of Rs. 767 per share with an upside of 34 percent over the CMP of Rs 550. The upside owes to ACIL\u2019s leading position in specialty marine chemical manufacturing, growing demand for bromine and industrial salts, expected good quarterly performance riding on demand revival in the medium term, upcoming expansion plans, rising demand for NaCl by ancillary industries, cost-effective production, and its strong financial performance over the past quarter.\n\n3/10 Elecon Engineering: Elecon Engineering is expected to reach a target price of Rs 1050 per share as against the CMP of Rs 869, resulting in a 21 percent upside. Nirmal Bang predicts this due to the company\u2019s leadership in the industrial gear market, strong growth prospects in sectors like cement and steel, a turnaround in the material handling equipment segment, and expectations of robust demand, resulting in an expected 25 percent CAGR in revenue and 32 percent CAGR in profits from FY23 to FY25, with an anticipated improvement in return on capital employed (ROCE).\n\n4/10 Five Star Business Finance: Nirmal Bang signalled a buy rating on the stock with a target price of Rs 1100, up 49 percent as against the CMP of Rs 740. Analysts are bullish on the stock due to the company\u2019s focus on providing secured business loans within a challenging segment with an average loan size of less than Rs. 5 Lakhs. Over FY23\u201325E, a 30 percent CAGR is anticipated due to Five Star's vast experience, strong return measures, rapid earnings growth, and cognizant financial management.\n\n5/10 Fusion Micro Finance: Owing to its status as India's 2nd largest NBFC-MFI, analysts see a 36 percent upside in the Fusion Micro Finance stock with a target price of Rs 820 with only a 30 percent discount to its competitor CreditAccess. The stock has reported strong assets under management (AUM) growth, excellent underwriting quality with lower GNPA levels than the industry and is expected to deliver industry-leading returns on assets (ROA) and equity (ROE) of 4.8 percent and 22 percent respectively in FY25E along with promising corporate governance practices.\n\n6/10 Sai Silk (Kalamandir) Ltd.: The stock has received a 'Buy' recommendation with a target price of Rs. 323, or 15x EV/EBITDA on FY25 EBITDA with a 37 percent upside from its CMP of Rs 236. According to the Nirmal Bang analyst research, the Sai Silk stock is expected to rise because of its robust market share in the expanding saree market in South India, variety of store formats, planned development, and strengthened financials. With an emphasis on the growing demand in the area for ethnic clothing, particularly sarees, the company is deemed attractive at an EV/EBITDA of 10.7x FY25E EBITDA.\n\n7/10 Sanghvi Movers Ltd.: Nirmal Bang sees an 18 percent upside with the target price of Rs 864 for the SML stock due to its leading position in the crane rental industry, significant growth potential in the windmill sector driven by government initiatives and the revival of wind farm capex, diversification into EPC work, improving capacity utilization and yield, and favourable industry tailwinds. The company's strong outlook suggests a growth trajectory, making it an attractive investment according to analysts.\n\n8/10 Venus Pipes & Tubes: Nirmal Bang sees a 34 percent upside in Venus's stock with a target price of Rs 1830 per share, valuing the company at 25x Sep 2025E earnings. This comes as Venus Pipes and Tubes is the only \u201cpure-play\u201d listed player in the high-value stainless steel pipe industry that has displayed strong growth potential. This growth is driven by capacity expansion, backward integration into manufacture of hollow pipes, favourable transition to direct sales, and their entry into the larger diameter pipes segment. These factors contribute to a Sales/PAT CAGR of 50 percent/78 percent over FY23-25E for the company, thus posing attractive opportunities for investors.\n\n9/10 Vishnu Chemicals Ltd (VCL): Vishnu Chemicals Ltd (VCL) receives a target price expectation of Rs. 421 per share, which is 30 percent higher than the current market price of Rs 325 based on the Nirmal Bang analyst report. This optimistic prediction is fuelled by VCL's leading position in the production of barium compounds and chromium chemicals, strong gross margins due to backward integration, a commitment towards product innovation, and the launch of \"precipitated barium sulphate,\" which is aimed at expanding the company's market. The company's anticipated capacity expansion also provides an additional backing for the presumption of a robust and consistent growth in its sales and profit.",

            "short_description": "What is market capitalisation? // The Motley Fool Australia  The Motley Fool Australia",
            "text": "Market capitalisation is one of the most common metrics an investor will seek on a company. Here, we examine what it is, how to calculate it, and how it can help you make sound investing decisions.\n\nWhat do we mean by market capitalisation?\n\nThe whole purpose of a share market is to facilitate the buying and selling of ownership stakes (shares) in publicly listed companies on a stock exchange, such as the ASX.\n\nMarket capitalisation (commonly abbreviated as 'market cap') measures the total dollar value the share market assigns to a listed company at any given time \u2013 nothing more, nothing less.\n\nHow does market cap work?\n\nAs with other markets, the stock market is accountable to the laws of supply and demand. At any given time, a company's share price reflects the price at which buyers and sellers are willing to trade company shares.\n\nIf demand for a company's shares increases (for example, if it issues a profit upgrade), its stock price will rise. But if the company's results fall short of expectations, demand for its shares will likely decrease \u2013 along with its market price.\n\nThe market also assigns a value to the entire company when it determines the share price. That's because each company has only a finite number of shares on issue.\n\nSuppose Motley Fool Magic Beans (a hypothetical company, for the record) has one million shares outstanding, and the market values them each at $1 a share. In that case, it effectively gives Motley Fool Magic Beans a market capitalisation of $1 million.\n\nBy the same logic, if the Motley Fool Magic Beans share price rises to $1.50 a share, its market capitalisation also increases to $1.5 million.\n\nSo, a company's share price fluctuations directly correlate with its market capitalisation at any given point in time.\n\nHow do we calculate a company's market capitalisation?\n\nThe formula for calculating a company's market cap is straightforward. You multiply the total number of outstanding shares by the current market price of one of its shares.\n\nHere's the formula to demonstrate:\n\nMarket cap = no. of shares outstanding x current stock price\n\nThat will give you an accurate market capitalisation for the company.\n\nLarge cap, small cap, micro cap \u2013 what do these terms mean?\n\nYou might have encountered some size references when investors talk of market caps. Mega cap, large cap, mid cap and small cap are standard terms, and you may have also heard of micro cap or even nano cap shares.\n\nCompany size is a helpful way to group investments. The size of a company's market cap can often tell you much about the company itself \u2013 particularly how risky it is to invest in.\n\nFor example, large-cap companies are often \u2013 but not always \u2013 mature, profitable companies with a demonstrated track record of success.\n\nOn the other hand, small-cap companies are typically just starting out and may have yet to turn a profit. Sometimes, they may even still be in their research and development phase.\n\nThis means that large-cap companies tend to be less risky than those with only small market caps. Companies with the lowest market caps \u2013 like micro caps and nano caps \u2013 should be treated as highly speculative investments.\n\nMany investors use a company's market cap as a determining factor when deciding whether or not to buy its shares. For example, you might purchase shares only in companies with larger market caps if you are more risk-averse.\n\nCompany size also helps define the businesses that an index, analyst, or fund manager might cover. For example, a micro-cap analyst is only interested in young companies with small market capitalisations.\n\nThere are no universal rules dictating what makes a large or small cap share, but here is a common framework:\n\nMega cap\n\nA mega-cap share typically has a market capitalisation of $200 billion or higher. There is only one share on the ASX with a market cap this big. That's the diversified miner BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP), which has a market capitalisation of about $240 billion at the time of writing.\n\nThe 'big four' bank, Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA), is not far off, with a market cap of about $190 billion.\n\nThere are many mega caps on global exchanges. These include tech juggernauts Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT), both with eye-watering market caps of around US$3 trillion.\n\nLarge cap\n\nLarge-cap stocks have a market capitalisation of $10 billion or higher. Most of the ASX 50 blue-chip companies come under this label.\n\nLeading biotech company CSL Limited (ASX: CSL), insurer QBE Insurance Group Ltd (ASX: QBE), and supermarket chain Woolworths Group Ltd (ASX: WOW) are all large-cap companies.\n\nMid cap\n\nA mid-cap company usually has a market capitalisation of between $2 billion and $10 billion. These shares aren't traditionally labelled 'blue chips' but can still be found in the ASX 100.\n\nPopular telco TPG Telecom Ltd (ASX: TPG), digital jobs listing company Seek Ltd (ASX: SEK), and airline Qantas Airways Ltd (ASX: QAN) are all mid-cap companies.\n\nSmall cap\n\nThese companies have a market cap ranging from a few hundred million dollars to $2 billion. They won't typically be found in the ASX 100 but might still appear in the S&P/ASX 200 Index (ASX: XJO). The S&P/ASX Small Ordinaries Index (ASX: XSO) aims to cover small-cap shares by excluding the ASX 100 from its listings.\n\nSome of the better-known ASX small-cap companies include bookmaker Tabcorp Holdings Ltd (ASX: TAH), poultry supplier Inghams Group Ltd (ASX: ING) and gambling company Star Entertainment Group Ltd (ASX: SGR), with market caps between $1.5 billion and $1.7 billion.\n\nMicro cap\n\nMicro-cap companies are often called 'penny stocks' and have market capitalisations typically ranging from $50 million to $300 million. Many ASX investors regard micro-cap stocks as a 'high-risk, high reward' arena and shy away from investing in this space.\n\nMicro-cap stocks include potential growth shares like accounting and financial services company Kelly Partners Group Holdings Ltd (ASX: KPG), breast cancer screening firm Volpara Health Technologies Ltd (ASX: VHT), and transport and freight company Silk Logistics Holdings Ltd (ASX: SLH).\n\nNano cap\n\nAny listed share with a market capitalisation of $50 million or less can be labelled a nano cap. These are highly speculative investments, as there is usually very little research or data available to retail ASX investors.\n\nNano-cap stocks may include junior companies, mineral exploration companies looking to strike it rich, or tech and biotech start-ups. Nano-cap shares are extremely risky, and you should ensure they align with your investing strategy before deciding to invest in them.\n\nWhat are the largest companies listed on the ASX?\n\nThe three largest companies on the ASX represent three of Australia's strongest economic sectors \u2013 mining, banking, and healthcare.\n\nCompany Description BHP Group Ltd (ASX: BHP) One of the world's largest diversified mining companies Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX: CBA) The biggest of Australia's 'big four' banks CSL Limited (ASX: CSL) Global leader in influenza vaccines and biotechnology\n\nBHP\n\nMining giant BHP is one of the largest mining companies in the world. It is the world's largest coal producer and generates significant amounts of nickel, copper, and iron ore. At this point, BHP is so extensive and well-diversified that investing in the company's shares is almost like buying a mining exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n\nThe company has a long and successful history. It was formed out of the merger of Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) and Billiton, two companies originally founded back in the 1800s.\n\nCBA\n\nCommonwealth Bank is easily the largest of Australia's big four banks. It is also one of the country's most recognisable and well-respected brands, making it a popular choice among retail investors. The bank pays a consistent and reliable dividend.\n\nCBA also has a long history. It was founded in 1911 by the Federal Government's Commonwealth Bank Act and held many central bank powers until the Reserve Bank of Australia was formed in 1960. The privatisation of CBA began in 1991 and was eventually completed in 1996.\n\nCSL\n\nCSL started life in 1916 as Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, a government enterprise originally intended to help safeguard the health of Australians during World War I. Over the years, the company has supplied the nation with modern treatments and medicines, including penicillin, insulin, and vaccines against polio and influenza.\n\nCSL has grown into a well-diversified biotech company, split into three key businesses. CSL Behring (which includes their plasma collection business) specialises in rare and severe diseases, CSL Seqirus develops vaccines for influenza, and CSL Vifor specialises in nephrology and iron deficiency.\n\nWhat's the difference between market cap and enterprise value?\n\nSome critics argue that a company's market cap only partially represents its true value \u2013 it considers only the value of its equity (or outstanding shares).\n\nAn alternative to market cap is enterprise value. Many consider it a more comprehensive way of valuing a company because it also accounts for cash reserves and debt.\n\nWe can calculate enterprise value using the following formula:\n\nEnterprise value = market cap + total debt \u2013 cash and cash equivalents\n\nEnterprise value is the preferred way to value companies targeted for a takeover or a buyout. This is because whoever acquires the company also takes on the debt and gains control of its cash reserves. Therefore, the acquirer must factor these items into its valuation before entering into a sale.\n\nDoes market capitalisation matter?\n\nWhen an investor attempts to value a company using a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio or similar metric, they are measuring the company's market capitalisation against its profitability or cash generation.\n\nIn this way, market capitalisation is a valuable tool in investing and can greatly assist in determining the correct share price to pay for a company. However, using a variety of financial metrics will help you make the best and most informed investment decisions.\n\nWith additional reporting by Motley Fool contributor Rhys Brock",

            "text": "Bank of Baroda | Rating: Buy | Target Price: Rs 300 | Upside Potential: 30%\n\nBank of Baroda (BoB) is one of the better placed PSBs (after SBI) with a loan book of Rs 10.26 lakh crore (4th largest bank in India after SBI, HDFC and ICICI). Stress recognition in the banking industry was the maximum during the period 2016-21; during this period BOB\u2019s slippages averaged at 4.3 per cent compared to 5.3 per cent for PSBs. Asset quality has consistently improved with NNPA declining to 0.76 per cent on asset quality. The impact of restriction by RBI for onboarding of new clients on the \u2018BoB World\u2019 app has been minimal as the portion of new account opening through the app was low. The issue is likely to be resolved soon. Growth in total advances is expected to be at 15 per cent. Although credit costs have bottomed out, we expect FY25E RoA/RoE to increase backed by stabilisation of NIM, higher growth in fee income and moderation in opex.\n\n\n\nDollar Industries | Rating: Buy | Target Price: Rs 300 | Upside Potential: 20%\n\nDollar Industries is a leading player in the branded innerwear category with over 2000 products across all segments.

Number of DFS dealers stood at 309 & EBOS 18 at the end of Q2FY24. The company plans to increase EBOS to 125 by 2026.\n\nA long term, Management guides revenue to grow to 2000 cr by FY26. High Margin Product contribution to increase to 33 per cent by FY26. Higher sales growth, lower raw material price with high margin product contribution will lead to improvement in margins. Management expects debtor days to improve to 70 to 75 days due to the Lakshya project and the dealer financing scheme that they are running. RoE of the company stood at 7 per cent in FY23 which is expected to improve going ahead. The stock is trading at a PE of 16.7 times FY 25E EPS which we feel is attractive.\n\n\n\nSai Silks (Kalamandir) | Rating: Buy | Target Price: Rs 344 | Upside Potential: 25%\n\nSai Silk , with presence majorly in Southern states including Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.

The company being amongst the top 10 retailers of ethnic apparel, particularly sarees, in south India in terms of revenues and profit and Saree contributing 68.4% to FY23 revenue. With presence in South India, Sai Silk intends its deepen its penetration in those areas, by opening 30 additional stores over 2 years for which the company will utilize Rs 125 crore of IPO net proceeds And also propose to open 5 additional stores in the franchise model. With growth and margins coming back , we feel stock is available at attractive valuation and is trading at EV/EBITDA of 12.6 times FY25E Ebitda. We recommend a Buy on the stock with a target price of Rs 344.\n\n\n\nSAMHI Hotels | Rating: Buy | Target Price: Rs 257 | Upside Potential: 54%\n\nSAMHI Hotels is a branded hotel ownership and asset management platform.

We are positive on the company's long term performance with substantial debt reduction and its ability to generate positive cash flow from FY25. We assign EV/EBITDA multiple of 18 times to FY25 EBITDA to arrive at a target of Rs 257.\n\n\n\nVenus Pipes & Tubes | Rating: Buy | Target Price: Rs 1,920 | Upside Potential: 37%\n\nVenus is the only pure-play listed player focused on the high value stainless steel pipe industry.

            "text": "Stock market news: The calendar year 2023 has turned out to be a phenomenal year for initial public offerings (IPOs) after a volatile 2022, given improving market conditions. A host of companies from diverse sectors launched their public issues to raise money. Moreover, many others are in the pipeline to go public.\n\nAfter a bull run in 2021, 2022 brought volatility due to high inflation, rising interest rates, and geopolitical tensions. As a result, many companies scrapped their IPO plans, citing unfavourable market conditions. However, in 2023, the total number of IPO listings has risen sharply and reached the highest level in the past five years, according to Trendlyne.\n\nSource: Trendlyne\n\nAmong the slew of issues, Sai Silks (Kalamandir) Ltd (SSKL), a leading apparel retailer in South India, made a quiet debut on the bourses in September. The scrip debuted at a mere 4 per cent premium over the IPO price of Rs 222 on September 27.\n\nSai Silks\u2019 Rs 1,201 crore IPO was subscribed 4.47 times. The retail portion, however, was subscribed only 0.91 times, whereas the qualified institutional buyer (QIB) portion received a total subscription of 12.17 times.\n\nThe Hyderabad-based company was founded by Prasad Chalavadi, a techie-turned-entrepreneur, in 2005. It houses four popular brands: Kalamandir (KMR), Kancheepuram, Vara Mahalakshmi Silks (VML), Mandir (MDR), and KLM Fashion Mall (KLM). As of July 31, 2023, the company had a network of 54 stores in four major south Indian states: Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu.\n\nWhat HDFC Securities says\n\nThe migration of retail trade of sarees to organised players from the unorganised sector, the company's foray into the Tamil Nadu market, improving financials from the COVID-19 blues, and its disciplined expansion approach are some of the key factors that make SSKL's stock attractive, notes HDFC Securities.\n\nThe company\u2019s extremely concentrated expansion approach (FY23 presence: 54 stores; 6,03,414 sq. ft in just 12 southern districts) ensures superior unit economics vis-\u00e0-vis most apparel peers (FY20-23 FCF/PAT conversion of 54%; FY20-FY23 average RoCE: 13-14 per cent), highlights Jay Gandhi, a research analyst with HDFC Securities, in a report dated November 23.\n\nThe report further highlights that the IPO proceeds will be utilised primarily to expand the more lucrative VML format in Tamil Nadu. The Tamil Nadu market (Rs 74 billion, 32 per cent share in the South) enjoys higher footfall density and consumer affinity for saree purchases. Hence, it is key for all saree brands.\n\nTaking into account these positive triggers, the domestic brokerage has initiated coverage on the stock with a 'buy' rating and target price of Rs 385. This translates to a 36 per cent upside from the November 22 closing price.\n\n\"We build in sales/EBITDA/PAT CAGRs of 19/27/40% for FY23-26E with average RoCEs of ~16% for FY23-26,\" the brokerage said. ROCE stands for return on capital employed.\n\nAs regards its financials, HDFC Securities says that SSKL\u2019s growth resilience and product affinity can be seen in its near-complete top-line recovery from the pandemic blues by FY22. In FY23, it continued to improve its performance (up 19 per cent YoY; Rs 13.52 bn; FY16-23 revenue CAGR: 16.7 per cent).\n\n\"For FY23\u201326, we build in a 19 per cent revenue CAGR and an EBITDAM expansion of nearly 300 bps, primarily trickling down from gross margins gains as SSKL earns higher sourcing margins from vendors by offering them better terms of trade and the premiumisation drive continues. 40 per cent profit after tax (PAT) CAGR built with a stable return profile for FY23\u201326,\" it adds.\n\nEBITDAM refers to earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, amortisation, and management fees.\n\nSource: HDFC Securities",

It houses four popular brands\u2014Kalamandir (KMR), Kancheepuram, Vara Mahalakshmi Silks (VML), Mandir (MDR), and KLM Fashion Mall (KLM)\u2014straddling multiple price points.\n\nAlso Read: Mamaearth shares jump 20% after Q2 results; Jefferies raises target on stock\n\nThe brokerage has listed the following key factors for its bullish outlook in its report:\n\nA benefactor of unorganised to organised migration in sarees: Historically, the retail trade of sarees was dominated by unorganised players in small-format stores. SSKL, along with a few other organised retailers, continues to solve the need to consolidate the SKUs and variety on offer for consumers via large-format retailing, said the brokerage.\n\nThe saree market in south India is pegged at \u20b9262 billion. With a noteworthy market share of 5%, the brokerage foresees the company as a primary beneficiary of this value migration.\n\nAlso Read: Primary market roars back as 3 of 4 IPOs sold out on Day One\n\nA strategic expansion model: The brokerage emphasised that the company has adopted a disciplined scaling strategy, focusing on a highly concentrated cluster-based expansion approach. Despite the availability of over 150 south districts, SSKL strategically operates in just 12 districts, boasting a robust presence of 54 stores covering 6,03,414 sq. ft. as of March 2023.\n\nThis intensive regional presence helps improve brand recall within catchments, which aids sales density and keeps the cost of retailing tight.\n\nAlso Read: IPO performance summary for H1 2023-24\n\nThe company enjoys the highest revenue per square foot ( \u20b922,000 per sq. ft) and is one of the most cost-effective retailing models within the apparel retail sector (25% of sales), the brokerage noted.\n\nTamil Nadu (TN) foray holds promise: The TN market, with a valuation of \u20b974 billion and a significant 32% share in the South, boasts a higher footfall density. This makes it a pivotal market for all saree brands.\n\nA substantial portion of Sai Silks Limited's (SSKL) IPO proceeds, amounting to \u20b95.66 billion, is allocated for expanding its presence in Tamil Nadu through Vara Mahalakshmi Silks (VML). VML is expected to exhibit approximately 2 times the revenue per square foot and 3\u20134 times the EBITDA per square foot compared to the company's average.\n\nGiven that SSKL has a mere 1% share in the TN market, SSKL\u2019s foray into the state via VML seems promising\u2014in terms of both growth and unit economics (25 out of 30 stores earmarked for expansion will be VML stores and in TN), the brokerage added.\n\nWhile recognising the potential of Sai Silks, the brokerage also outlined some of the few risks. These include a high concentration in a single product category (saree), potential challenges in SKU management (saree high SKU/store product), and heightened competition from e-tailers.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations given in this article are those of individual analysts.

It owns Bunnings, Kmart, Officeworks, and Priceline. Other retailers also finished higher today. The JB Hi-Fi Limited (ASX: JBH) share price closed up 2.3%, the Nick Scali Limited (ASX: NCK) share price gained 1.1%, and the Harvey Norman Holdings Limited (ASX: HVN) share price climbed 4.16% after its latest trading update.\n\nHealthcare deal completed\n\nWesfarmers announced it had completed the acquisition of all of the shares of Silk Laser Australia Ltd (ASX: SLA).\n\nSilk will become part of the Wesfarmers Health division, and will complement the Clear Skincare business by providing \"additional scale and efficiency benefits in the attractive and growing market for medical aesthetics products and services\".\n\nThe Wesfarmers Health director Emily Amos said:\n\nThrough this acquisition, we are looking to build a leading medical aesthetics operator in Australia and New Zealand. We see strong operational and cultural alignment between our businesses and look forward to working with the SILK team and SILK's joint venture and franchisee partners to support their customers and deliver continued growth.\n\nWesfarmers paid a total of $3.25 per share to Silk Laser Australia shareholders to bring the total cash consideration to $3.35 per share, including a 10 cents per share special dividend paid to Silk shareholders since the announcement of the scheme.\n\nWhen adding the two elements of the takeover together, it reflected an acquisition equity value of approximately $180 million.\n\nSilk will apply to be removed from the ASX, which is expected to occur from the close of trade on 30 November 2023.\n\nThis deal adds to the other acquisitions that Wesfarmers has made in the healthcare space including InstantScripts and Australian Pharmaceutical Industries (which came with Priceline and Clear Skincare Clinics).\n\nWesfarmers share price snapshot\n\nAs we can see on the chart below, the Wesfarmers share price is up 16% this year and it has risen 7% over the last six months.",

            "text": "The newly-listed Sai Silks (Kalamandir) has been seeing strong investor interest, rising almost 35 percent from its issue price in just 2 months. In a recent note, domestic brokerage house HDFC Securities has initiated coverage on the stock with a \u2018buy\u2019 recommendation and a target price of \u20b9385, indicating an upside of 29 percent from its current market price of \u20b9298.75, as on November 24.\n\nThe bullish call is on the back of strong financial performance, a robust track record, and a healthy growth potential in the saree industry.\n\nThe \u20b91,201 crore initial public offering (IPO) was open for subscription between September 20 and September 22 with a price range of \u20b9210-222. The issue included a fresh share sale of \u20b9600 crore and an offer for sale (OFS) of up to 2.70 crore equity shares by its promoter group shareholders.\n\nThe issue was overall subscribed to 4.47 times. The qualified institutional bidders' (QIBs) allocation was booked 12.17 times, while the portion for non-institutional investors was subscribed to 2.54 times. However, the quota reserved for retail investors saw only 91 percent bidding.\n\nThe stock was listed on September 27, 2023, at \u20b9231 on the NSE, a 4 percent premium to the issue price. From its listing price, the stock has advanced over 29 percent till date.\n\nSoon after listing, the stock witnessed some profit booking. However, it has shown tremendous recovery in November so far. It has surged over 25 percent just in November after a 5.6 percent fall in October.\n\nThe stock hit its record high of \u20b9302.40 in the previous session (November 24, 2023).\n\nAbout the firm\n\nLaunched in FY05, Sai Silks (Kalamandir) Ltd (SSKL) is one of the largest apparel retailers in south India, offering products across ethnic wear (predominantly sarees) and value fashion. The retailer houses four popular brands\u2014Kalamandir, Kancheepuram Vara Mahalakshmi Silks, Mandir and KLM Fashion Mall\u2014straddling multiple price points. Their cluster-based presence (spanning 54 stores; 6,02,414 sq. ft) across the four southern states (Telangana, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Tamil Nadu) ensures superior operating efficiencies/unit economics.\n\nInvestment Rationale\n\nA benefactor of unorganised to organised migration in sarees: Historically, the retail trade of sarees was dominated by unorganised players in small format stores. SSKL, along with a few other organised retailers, continues to solve the need to consolidate SKUs/variety on offer for consumers via large-format retailing. The saree market in south India is pegged at \u20b926200 crore (overall saree market: \u20b952,393 crore). SSKL (5 percent market share) is expected to be the key beneficiary of this value migration as it is attacking a broad consumer cohort at multiple prices\u2014 KMR (ASP: \u20b91,760), VML (ASP: \u20b94,800), MDR (ASP: \u20b913,400), and KLM (ASP: \u20b9800), stated the brokerage.\n\nSSKL\u2014a smart scaler: SSKL has been a disciplined scaler with an extremely concentrated cluster-based expansion approach. Of the 150+ south districts, SSKL is only present in 12 (presence: 54 stores spanning 6,03,414 sq. ft as of Mar-23). Such a dense presence typically helps improve brand recall within catchments, ergo aids sales density and keeps the cost of retailing tight, noted HDFC. It also pointed out that SSKL enjoys amongst the highest revenue/sq. ft ( \u20b922k/sq. ft) and among the lowest retailing costs within apparel retail (25 percent of sales).\n\nTamil Nadu (TN) foray holds promise: The brokerage noted that TN market ( \u20b97400 crore, 32 percent share in the South) enjoys higher footfall density and consumer affinity for saree purchases. Hence, it is key for all saree brands. Most of SSKL\u2019s IPO proceeds are earmarked to expand its TN presence via VML. Given that SSKL has a mere 1 percent share in TN, SSKL\u2019s foray into the state via VML seems promising\u2014in terms of both growth and unit economics, said HDFC (25 out of 30 stores earmarked for expansion will be VML stores and in TN).\n\nFinancial Analysis:\n\nRevenue: The brokerage informed that SSKL has delivered 17 percent revenue CAGR over FY16-23. While most of the growth is expansion-led, SSSG has hovered at 2-4 percent typically. Interestingly, an SSSG of 3 percent is sufficient to cover store-level cost inflation as store-level costs are estimated to account for only 15 percent of sales while central costs constitute the remaining 10 percent of sales, noted HDFC.\n\nVML format (superior unit economics vis-\u00e0-vis other formats) will be the vehicle for expansion (of the 30 stores to be funded via IPO proceeds, 25 stores are earmarked for VML in Tamil Nadu). The brokerage built-in 30/44 VML/total store additions for FY23-26 (IPO proceeds + internal accrual funded) and expects VML to add over 80 percent of incremental sales over FY23-26 (60 percent of incremental area addition). Overall, for SSKL, it builds in 19 percent revenue CAGR for FY23-26.\n\nNet profit: Improvement in net profit (built-in 40 percent CAGR over FY23-26) is a result of gross margin gains, steady cost of retailing and reduction of \u20b912-15 crore in interest outgo due to paring down of debt from IPO proceeds + internal accruals. The brokerage has built-in \u20b9189/269 crore PAT in FY25/26, respectively.\n\nEBITDA margin (EBITDAM): EBITDA margin expanded by 562/449 bps over FY20-23 as the company continued to (1) premiumise its offerings, (2) take consistent price hikes, and (3) have an increased skew of higher EBITDAM format VML (skew increased from 36 percent of sales to 39 percent of sales), noted HDFC. GM increased from 31.5 percent to 39.1 percent over FY20-23.\n\nGiven that the predominant vehicle for expansion here on is VML (higher EBITDAM format courtesy of higher sales density and lower A&P and business promotion needs), the natural rise in skew should aid EBITDAM expansion over FY23-26. SSKL also intends to work on improving sourcing margins, ergo gross margins, by offering better terms of trade to its weaver network. This coupled with its consistent premiumisation drive should aid GMs, which should trickle down at the EBITDAM level too. The brokerage estimates a 267/280 bps EBITDAM expansion over FY23-26.\n\nTrack record and expectations\n\n\"SSKL\u2019s growth resilience and product affinity can be seen in its near-complete top-line recovery from the pandemic blues by FY22. In FY23, it continued to improve its performance (up 19 percent YoY; \u20b91352 crore; FY16-23 revenue CAGR: 16.7 percent). EBITDAM expanded (9.3 percent in FY20 vs 13.7 percent in FY23; HSIE), led by continued premiumisation across formats and price hikes. RoCE/RoE improved from 17 percent/20 percent in FY20 to 19 percent/27 percent in FY23 respectively. For FY23-26, we build in 19 percent revenue CAGR and an EBITDAM expansion of 300 bps primarily trickling down from GM gains as SSKL earns higher sourcing margins from vendors by offering them better terms of trade and the premiumisation drive continues. 15 percent and 16.7 percent EBITDAM baked in for FY25/26. 40 percent PAT CAGR built with a stable return profile for FY23-26,\" forecasted the brokerage.\n\nKey risks, as per HDFC:\n\n1. Highly concentrated in a single product category (saree).\n\n2. A slip-up in SKU management (saree is a high SKU/store product) could impact working capital.\n\n3. Heightened competitive intensity from e-tailers.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

            "text": "Buy or sell stocks for today: Posting a strong recovery from morning lows aided by recovery in bank stocks, the Indian stock market ended higher on Wednesday. The Nifty 50 index finished 96 points higher at the 21,840 level, the BSE Sensex surged 267 points and closed at the 71,822 mark while the Bank Nifty index ended 405 points up at the 45,908 level.\n\nIn the broad market, both small-cap and mid-cap indices outperformed Nifty even as the advance-decline ratio recovered sharply to 1.95:1. Oil & Gas, and Metal stocks also witnessed heightened activity in the previous session.\n\nIntraday trading tips for Thursday\n\nVaishali Parekh, Vice President \u2014 Technical Research at Prabhudas Lilladher believes that overall sentiment on Dalal Street has improved after the Nifty 50 index closed the 21,800 level. The Prabhudas Lilladher expert anticipated further extension of Wednesday's pullback provided the 50-stock index sustains above 21,750 to 21,770 levels. Vaishali Parekh went on to add that a further rise in the Bank Nifty today can be expected once the index breaches above 46,100 level.\n\nOn stocks to buy today, Vaishali Parekh of Prabhudas Lilladher recommended three intraday stocks for today \u2014 Vedanta, Apollo Tyres, and Hindustan Copper.\n\nStock market today\n\nOn the outlook of the Nifty 50 index, Vaishali Parekh said, \"Nifty after opening with a gap down on a weak note near 21530 zone, witnessed a strong pullback as the day progressed and after a long time breached above the 21800 level to improve the bias and sentiment anticipating for extended gains in the coming sessions. The index would need to sustain above the 21750-21770 zone for the bias to remain intact and expect for next targets to retest the previous levels of 22000 and 22150 in the coming days.\"\n\n\"Bank Nifty also gave a strong recovery from the 44900 zone of the significant 200 period MA and gained momentum as the day progressed to cross above the 46000 level during the intraday session. With the index closing on a decent note, further ahead a decisive breach above the 50EMA level of the 46100 zone shall further improve the bias and can anticipate further rise,\" said Parekh.\n\nParekh went on to add that the immediate support for Nifty today is placed at 21,700 while the resistance is seen at the 22,000 mark. Bank Nifty would have a daily range of 45,500 to 46,500 levels.\n\nStocks to buy today\n\n1] Vedanta: Buy at \u20b9279.65, target \u20b9293, stop loss \u20b9273;\n\n2] Apollo Tyres: Buy at \u20b9517.95, target \u20b9542, stop loss \u20b9505; and\n\n3] Hindustan Copper: Buy at \u20b9259.45, target \u20b9272, stop loss \u20b9253.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of individual analysts, experts, and broking companies, not of Mint.

The Nifty 50 index added 19 points and closed at the 22,493 level, the BSE-sensitive index Sensex went up 33 points and ended at the 74,119 mark whereas the Bank Nifty index finished 129 points lower at 47,865 level.

The Prabhudas Lilladher expert went on to add that the 50-stock index could surge to a new peak due to strong buying in the Tata group stocks.\n\nOn stocks to buy today, Vaishali Parekh recommended three buy or sell stocks for today and those three shares are PVR, HDFC Life, and ITC.\n\nAlso Read: Why Nvidia share price is plummeting after 80% rally in YTD \u2014 explained\n\nStock market today\n\nOn the outlook for the Nifty 50 today, Vaishali Parekh said, \"The Nifty 50 index hit a record high of 22,525.40 during the intraday session on Thursday, with TATA's stocks leading from the front and helping the index touch the peak level. Overall, with the bias and sentiment looking strong, it is anticipated to carry on the momentum still further to scale 22,800 to 23,000 levels.\"\n\n\"Bank Nifty, which has already indicated strength, is gradually on the rise and is hovering near the 48,000 zones with positive bias maintained, with frontline banking stocks like HDFC Bank, Kotak Bank, and IndusInd Bank looking good for the near-term future. With the indices at their peak levels, some consolidation is anticipated, with the trend remaining strong and further rises expected in the coming days,\" said Parekh.\n\nParekh went on to add that the support for the week is seen at 73,000/22,000 levels, while the resistance is seen at 75,200/23,000 levels.
