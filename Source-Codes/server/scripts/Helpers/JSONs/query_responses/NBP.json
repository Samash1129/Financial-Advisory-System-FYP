            "text": "The National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) branch building can be seen. \u2014 NBP website\n\nKARACHI: National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), one of the country's largest lenders, on Thursday posted a 72 percent surge in annual profit after tax, driven by a sharp rise in interest income.\n\nNBP reported a profit after tax of Rs53.32 billion for the calendar year 2023, up from RS30.95 billion in the previous year, according to a notice sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Earnings per share rose to Rs24.96 from Rs14.49, the bank said, adding that its board did not recommend any cash dividend.\n\nThe bank attributed the strong performance to a nearly 104 percent increase in mark-up/return earned, which reached Rss1,025.13 billion in 2023, compared to Rs503.58 billion in 2022.\n\nThe net mark-up/return earned jumped 45 percent to Rs169.36 billion, while its fee and commission income rose 7 percent to Rs24.14 billion.\n\nThe foreign exchange income, however declined 7 percent to Rs7.7 billion , and its operating expenses increased 20 percent to Rs95.45 billion.\n\nThe NBP also recorded a 294 percent gain on securities of Rs4.42 billion, and a Rs227 percent increase in share of profit from joint venture and association of Rs1.47 billion.\n\nThe profit before tax stood at Rs103.3 billion, up 62 percent from the previous year. Maintaining its leading market position, the bank achieved Rs6.5 trillion milestone in its balance sheet that grew 27 percent to reach Rs6,652.7 billion from Rs5,240.4 billion at the end of 2022,\" NBP said in a statement. \"This makes NBP the largest bank in Pakistan in terms of total assets.\"\n\nThe statement said bank's board \"deliberated at length whether or not cash dividend should be recommended\". \"However, the likely impact of the pension case and other contingencies, still remains a cause of concern for the board. Accordingly, the board considered it prudent to retain the profits for the time being and once the position becomes clearer, the bank may consider declaration of dividend at a later stage.\"\n\nIMC posts 88.6 percent profit rise despite sales slump\n\nIndus Motor Company Limited (IMC), the maker of Toyota cars in Pakistan, reported an 88.6 percent jump in profit after tax for the six months ended December 31, 2023, despite a sharp drop in sales and production due to weak demand and supply chain disruptions.\n\nThe company posted a profit after tax of Rs4.96 billion #, up from Rs2.63 billion in the same period a year earlier, according to a statement issued on Thursday.\n\nThe net sales turnover decreased by 41.4 percent to Rs50.91 billion, as compared to Rs86.83 billion for the same period last year. The company's overall market share for the quarter stood at 18 percent.\n\nThe earnings per share of the company for the half year ended December 31, 2023, was Rs63.07, in comparison to of Rs33.43 in the same period last year.\n\nThe board of directors declared a second interim cash dividend of Rs13.20 per share. This is in addition to the first interim cash dividend of Rs24.5 per share already paid.\n\nThe combined sales of CKD and CBU vehicles decreased by 61 percent to 7,324 units compared to 18,672 units sold in the previous year. Vehicle production too decreased by 66 percent to 6,391 units as compared to 18,562 units produced in the same period last year.\n\nThe decline in production was mainly due to weak consumer demand and vendor supply chain limitations, which led to regular plant shutdowns during the period, the company said.\n\n\"The country's economy continues to grapple with high fiscal deficit, sky rocketing inflation and power tariff hikes. Customer traffic at dealerships remained lackluster, owing to several factors, such as higher duties and taxes, high interest rates, low auto financing availability and relatively dampened consumer purchasing power,\" IMC Chief Executive, Ali Asghar Jamali, said in the statement.\n\nHe added that supply chain challenges continued to adversely affect the auto sector, as a consequence of which, it operated at below 30 percent production capacity, the lowest in the last decade, leading to forced frequent plant shutdowns.\n\nJamali also said that the company faced challenges in maintaining a level playing field within the automotive sector due to consistent rise in duties and taxes for locally manufactured vehicles while on the other hand, the government relaxed the import and taxation regime for used cars, thereby emphasizing the need for fair competition.\n\n\"Despite all the challenges, I am hopeful that with the new government in place, the country and the overall business environment shall well be on its path to stability, In Sha Allah,\" he said.\n\nSPL posts 122 percent jump in half-year profit\n\nSecurity Papers Limited (SPL) reported a 122 percent surge in its net profit for the first half of the financial year ending December 31, 2023, boosted by higher sales and improved margins.\n\nThe company said its profit after tax rose to Rs746 million, or Rs12.59 per share, in the six months ended June 30, 2023, from Rs336 million, or Rs5.67 per share, in the same period last year. Its revenue increased by 38 percent to Rs3.49 billion from Rs2.53 billion a year earlier.\n\nThe company's gross profit margin improved to 28 percent from 19 percent in the same period last year, as its cost of sales grew by 26 percent to Rs2.51 billion from Rs1.99 billio.\n\nSPL chairman Mohammad Aftab Manzoor attributed the strong performance to the company's strategic focus on operational efficiency and cost reduction, as well as the positive impact of several reforms introduced in the company.\n\n\u201cOur strategic vision and relentless focus on new initiatives and diversification has more than doubled the EPS of the company. The SPL\u2019s strong performance is a testament to its commitment to progress aimed at delivering value to shareholders and customers,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nManzoor also expressed confidence in the future prospects of the company, citing a recently signed technical consultancy agreement with a leading European security paper company that will help SPL benchmark its operational efficiencies and prepare comprehensive efficiency and cost improvement plans. The company also announced an interim cash dividend of Rs2.5 per share.",

Along with the quarterly results, the company's board will also consider an interim dividend payout to shareholders.The new business premium (NBP) during the third quarter is expected to fall 6% year-on-year to Rs 48,811 crore, and the annualised premium equivalent (APE) is seen dropping 9% year-on-year, according to YES Securities.The value of new business (VNB) is also likely to fall 8% year-on-year to Rs 1,841 crore in the quarter ended December.The growth assumptions are based on trends observed till November 2023, when LIC had displayed NBP and APE growth of 7% and -11%, respectively for October and November 2023.YES Securities estimated VNB margins expansion of 20bps quarter-on-quarter based on expected business mix changes.Shares of LIC had a stellar run in the recent past, scaling lifetime peak of Rs 1,050 following 71% spike in the last 3 months. LIC, which was struggling to cross its IPO price of Rs 949 in 2022, have now breached the Rs 1,000-mark.In December, the finance ministry had granted time to the PSU insurer for complying with 25% minimum public shareholding till 2032. The stock has been rallying since then as the exemption reduces the possibility of an offer for sale (OFS) by the government.In May 2022, the government had sold 3.5% stake in LIC IPO which was an entirely (offer for sale) worth around Rs 21,000 crore. It remains India's largest IPO till date.Analysts expect the positive upside to continue on expectations of growth revival in FY25, and the possibility of a step change in dividend will continue to support its share price performance.\"With the worst, in terms of structural issues of growth differential and sticky cost, now likely to be behind, LIC shares have entered the outperformance mode since H1FY24 results, led by favorable valuation, strong EV growth on account of buoyant equity markets, hope of growth revival in FY25 owing to a favorable base and widening of product offering, and likely hope of a step jump in dividend,\" Emkay Global had said.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

            "text": "Shares of Life Insurance Corporation of India surged nearly 10% on Friday (November 24) \u2014 the most since its listing on a closing basis, amid expectations of double-digit growth in new business premiums. New business premium (NBP) is the premium, which is due on policy in the first year of a life insurance contract or a single lump sum payment from the policyholder.\n\nWith Friday\u2019s gain, the stock of LIC has rallied as much as 27% over the last eight months. Yet, the stock is trading some 30% below to its IPO price. The trading volume on the counters went up to nearly two crores, which is 18 times the three-month average of about 10 lakh shares. In fact, the combined volume on BSE and NSE surged to the second biggest ever.\n\nThe rally in shares also saw LIC\u2019s market capitalisation swell by \u20b9 38,000 crore on Friday, which stands at \u20b9 4.3 lakh crore.\n\nIn an interaction with news agency PTI, Chairman Siddhartha Mohanty sounded quite optimistic on achieving double digit growth in new business premiums in FY24. Mohanty observed that higher growth based on recent trends showed an \u201cuptick in individual retail business.\u201d In order to further reinforce our commitment, we are going to launch some new attractive products, added Mohanty.\n\nHowever, in the first half of the current financial year, LIC clocked 2.7% growth in new business premium, which increased to \u20b9 25,184 crore from \u20b9 24,535 crore reported in the same period last year. For FY23, the growth in the new business premium segment was 6.9%. LIC\u2019s moat is its strong agency network (1.35mn) which commands 49% market share and contributed 96% of the company\u2019s individual NBP at end-H1FY24.",

            "text": "By Shabbir H. Kazmi\n\nThe week ending on March 22, 2024 started on a positive note, witnessed uncertainty over interest rate cuts erasing some gains from the initial days. Overall the benchmark index closed at 65,152 points, with a gain of 335 points or 0.5%WoW.\n\nOn Monday, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) decided to maintain the interest rate at 22%, the decision did not impact the stock market as it was already expected and priced-in.\n\nThe talks with the IMF mission on the SBA\u2019s second review concluded on Tuesday with staff-level agreement, resulting in infused positivity into the equity market and international investors as well with appreciation in dollar bonds and Pakistan Stock Exchange benchmark index.\n\nAs discussions progressed, prerequisites for the next medium-term programs have surfaced, primarily focusing on broadening the tax base. News has circulated about a new plan to collect taxes from retailers through electricity bills, which has been shared with the IMF.\n\nAdditionally, IMF has recommended eliminating GST exemptions on petroleum products and other taxes, whereby, despite a easing weekly inflation, an increase in gas price (as sought by Sui twins) and implementation of 18%GST on POL products pose risks to the inflation outlook.\n\nOn the economic front, current account for February 2024 turned positive, with a surplus of US$128 million, bringing 8MFY24 CAD below the US$1.0 billion mark.\n\nWith a controlled current account balance, SBP\u2019s reserve position also improved by US$105 million WoW to reach US$8.0 billion as of March 15, 2024.\n\nWith the IMF\u2019s smooth review, market participation improved by 13%WoW, with the daily traded volume averaging at 323 million shares as compared to 287 million shares a week ago.\n\nOther major news flows during the week included: 1) During first eight months of the current financial year the GoP borrowed US$6.678 billion from multiple sources, 2) FDI dropped over 17% to US$820.6 million during these eight months, 3) IT exports raised by 32% to US$257 million during February, and 4) the Supreme Court ordered NBP National Bank of Pakistan to pay PKR60 billion in pensions to retired employees.\n\nThe top performing sectors of the week were Transport, Inv. banks/ securities cos. and Tobacco, while Synthetic & Rayon, Cement, and Refinery were amongst the worst performers.\n\nMajor selling was recorded by companies with a net sell of US$9.0 million. Insurance absorbed most of the selling with a net buy of US$24.1 million.\n\nTop performing scrips of the week were: Company-wise, top performers during the week were: NBP, DAWH, PTC, CEPB, and MEBL, while laggards included: NRL, PIOC, CNERGY, HCAR, FCCL.\n\nWith the aforementioned tax reforms, price increases, particularly with the imposition of GST on POL products, could pose a risk to the CPI outlook and potential delay in interest rate cuts, resulting in restrained market performance. However, successful implementation of tax reforms would have a positive impact on long-term economic stability.\n\nAdditionally, with SBP REER increasing to 102.2 in February 2024, there is a risk of PKR depreciation, especially in case of increased smuggling or imports.\n\nInvestors are advised to remain cautious and maintain positions in strong valuation main board stocks, particularly those offering attractive dividend yields.",

            "text": "Life insurers collected 43.76 per cent higher new business premium (NBP) in December 2023 year-on-year (Y-o-Y) on the back of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC)'s strong performance. The NBP of LIC, which has been looking to arrest a fall in its market share, almost doubled. This was also the first month in the current financial year when market leader LIC's NBP grew.\n\nNBP refers to premium acquired from new policies for a particular period and is a key indicator of insurance sector growth. Click here to follow our WhatsApp channel\n\nThe life insurance industry earned premiums worth Rs 38,583 crore last month, up 43.8 per cent from Rs 26,838.3 crore in the year-ago period, according to data released by Life Insurance Council. Public sector giant LIC\u2019s premiums soared 93.8 per cent to Rs 22,981.3 crore from Rs 11,858.5 crore on the back of multifold growth in group business (where many people are covered in the same contract).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, private insurers\u2019 premiums grew 4.15 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 15,601.8 crore from Rs 14,979.8 crore.\n\n\n\nThe group single premium business of LIC rose by 195 per cent to Rs 17,601.9 crore from Rs 5,966.9 crore in the year-ago period. The overall group premium for December 2023 stood at Rs 17,812.5 crore against Rs 6,407.4 crore for the same month last year.\n\n\n\nAmong private insurance companies, SBI Life Insurance, the largest private insurer, reported a 20.73 per cent decline in premiums to Rs 4,606.8 crore. The NBP count of HDFC Life Insurance inched up 3.26 per cent to Rs 2,842.9 crore.\n\n\n\nOf the remaining listed players, NBP tally of ICICI Prudential Life Insurance rose 2.89 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 1,497.3 crore, while Max Life Insurance recorded 17.6 per cent growth to see its NBP grow to Rs 1,213.9 crore.\n\nFY24 performance so far\n\n\n\nDespite its strong December performance, LIC posted a 16.2 per cent Y-o-Y decline in premium for April-December 2023, which stood at Rs 1.47 trillion down from Rs 1.76 trillion in the same period last year. From April-November 2023, LIC's new premiums had fallen 24.2 per cent Y-o-Y to Rs 1.24 trillion from Rs 1.64 trillion in the last year's corresponding period.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, the private sector reported a 10.4 per cent rise in NBP in April-December to Rs 1.02 trillion.\n\n\n\nSBI Life Insurance saw 20.9 per cent Y-o-Y growth in premiums to Rs 26,000 crore, whereas HDFC Life Insurance witnessed 10.3 per cent growth in premium to Rs 20,344.3 crore.",

            "text": "Amid the ongoing rally in Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) stock, the market capitalisation (m-cap) of the state-owned insurance behemoth surged nearly Rs 1.8 lakh crore in the past two months. M-cap of the public sector insurer jumped to around Rs 5.65 lakh crore on January 16, 2024 as against Rs 3.86 lakh crore on November 16, 2023. Shares of LIC jumped 46 per cent to Rs 892.50 during the same period. Meanwhile, the scrip scaled a 52-week high of Rs 900 on January 16.\n\nOf late, life insurers collected 43.76 per cent higher year-on-year new business premium (NBP) in December 2023 on the back of LIC\u2019s strong performance, which saw 93.79 per cent growth in NBP. However, the market share of LIC stood at 58.9 per cent as of December 31, 2023, as against 65.4 per cent a year ago.\n\nAccording to KR Choksey Shares and Securities, LIC has been focusing on product mix improvements, with a stronger focus on the non-par segment and that LIC will capitalise on the industry\u2019s growth opportunities, aided by its significant AUM and geographical expansion.\n\nEarlier, shares of LIC witnessed heavy selling pressure after listing on bourses in May 2022. After listing at Rs 867.20, the scrip scaled an all-time low of Rs 530.2 on March 29, 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, the market capitalisation of the country\u2019s largest lender by assets State Bank of India (SBI) increased by Rs 46,765 crore to Rs 5.68 lakh crore on January 16, 2024 from Rs 5.22 lakh crore on November 16, 2023. This shows that the gap between the m-cap of LIC and SBI narrowed down to Rs 3,813 crore on January 16, 2024 as against Rs 1.36 lakh crore on November 16, 2023.",

            "text": "Life insurance industry\u2019s new business premium (NBP) is expected to grow 9-12 per cent in FY24 to \u20b94.06-4.14-lakh crore, and by 11-13 per cent to \u20b94.49-4.66-lakh crore in FY25, up from \u20b93.71-lakh crore in FY23, according to ICRA.\n\nWith steady growth in renewal premium income, the gross premium written (GPW) is expected to increase to \u20b98.56-8.64-lakh crore in FY24 and \u20b99.37-9.55-lakh crore in FY25 from \u20b97.86-lakh crore in FY23.\n\n\u201cNotwithstanding the contraction in NBP for LIC\u2019s group business, the private sector continues to maintain the growth momentum in individual as well as group businesses. Accordingly, we expect the NBP expansion for private sector to continue to outpace industry growth,\u201d said Neha Parikh, Vice-President and Sector Head \u2013 Financial Sector Ratings.\n\nICRA pegged NBP expansion for private life insurers at 13-16 per cent to \u20b91.57-1.59-lakh crore in FY24 and further by 14-16 per cent to \u20b91.80-1.87-lakh crore in FY25, adding that their market share in NBP is expected to increase to 40 per cent by FY25 from 37 per cent in FY23.\n\nNew business premium\n\nIndividual NBP for the industry expanded 15.4 per cent y-o-y in FY23 to \u20b91.45-lakh crore, partly attributed to the significant growth in the guaranteed non-paticipating individual segment.\n\n\u201cThe expansion was also driven by the levy of taxes on the returns from these policies if the annual premium paid exceeded \u20b95 lakh per annum. This change was applicable from April 2023 onwards leading to sharp increase in premium in FY23,\u201d ICRA said in the note.\n\nThis resulted in moderation in the industry\u2019s individual NBP growth to 7.7 per cent y-o-y in H1 FY24, and is expected to rise by 8-10 per cent in FY24 and 10-12 per cent in FY25.\n\nOn the other hand, industry group NBP contracted 22.6 per cent in H1 FY24 because of shrinkage in LIC\u2019s group business. The segment accounted for 75 per cent of LIC\u2019s NBP in FY23 and LIC accounted for 63 per cent of industry NBP.\n\n\u201cRevival in its (LIC\u2019s) group business will be critical for the overall NBP growth of the industry. In the absence of this, the NBP for the industry is likely to contract,\u201d ICRA said.\n\nDespite the growth in NBP, VNB (value of new business) growth for the industry is estimated to moderate in FY24, as the share of high margin (guaranteed non-participating individual) businesses is likely to decline, it said, adding that for LIC it will also remain contingent on its ability to diversify its product mix and widen its distribution network.\n\nSHARE Copy link\n\nEmail\n\nFacebook\n\nTwitter\n\nTelegram\n\nLinkedIn\n\nWhatsApp\n\nReddit",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares of Life Insurance Corporation ( LIC ) jumped 10% today to record best single-day gain since listing. Investors appear to be buoyed by the company's plans to launch 3-4 new products over the coming months to push growth in its new business premium (NBP).Trading at 20 times its 20-day average trading volume, LIC shares hit two-month high at Rs 680 and surpassed above its 50 and 100-DMA levels.A similar buying interest was also seen in two other PSU insurance stocks. While General Insurance Corporation of India shares jumped 18%, the counter of The New India Assurance Company was locked in 20% upper circuit limit.LIC Chairman Siddhartha Mohanty had told PTI in an interview that the state-run insurer was projecting a double-digit growth in the current financial year over the last year. LIC intends to achieve this goal by launching some new attractive products, Mohanty revealed.LIC is going to launch one product in the first week of December, he said, hoping that it will attract a lot of traction in the market. In addition, he said, loan facility and premature withdrawal would also be a feature of the new product.Guaranteed return products are in the interest of policyholders and shareholders, he said, adding that many shareholders are also policyholders. \"So, it is a dual benefit for policyholders,\" he had said.The stock has been a market laggard and returned just approximately 3% returns in the last 12 months as against 8% returns given by the Nifty. In 2023, its performance has been even worse with over 9% price erosion over the previous year.Since its listing on May 17, 2022, the stock has been on a downhill and fell to a low of Rs 530.05 on March 23, 2023. Though it has made an upward move, it is still trading at a 44% discount from its issue price of Rs 949.LIC's Q2 earnings have also failed to inspire any confidence among the investors. India's largest life insurer reported a 50% decline in net profit to Rs 7,925 crore for the quarter ending September 30, 2023.During the same period last year, LIC had reported a net profit of Rs 15,952 crore. However, LIC clarified that these profits are not directly comparable due to accounting changes.LIC changed its accounting policy in September 2022 regarding the transfer of the amount (net of tax) related to the accretion on the available solvency margin from the non-participating policyholder's account to the shareholder's account.During FY23, Rs 27,241 crore (net of tax) was transferred, including Rs 14,272 crore (net of tax) in the quarter ended September 2022.In the first-half of FY23, the actual profit increased by 44.45% to Rs 17,469 crore from Rs 12,093 crores. This half-year profit incorporates an amount of Rs 13,768 crore (net of tax), related to the accretions on the available solvency margin, transferred from the non-par fund to the shareholders' account. The Solvency Ratio, as of September 30, 2023, improved to 1.90 compared to 1.88.The value of new business (VNB) for the six-month period ending September 30, 2023 fell 10% to Rs 3,304 crore, compared to Rs 3,677 crore in the corresponding period last year, while the net VNB margin for this period remained constant at 14.6%.",

            "text": "Shares of Life Insurance Corporation of India Ltd. (LIC) crossed its listing day price of \u20b9904 for the first time on Wednesday, January 17, making an intraday high of \u20b9918.45. The stock had crossed its listing price of \u20b9867 and the price of \u20b9889, which is the price at which policyholders were allotted shares on Tuesday.India's largest insurer has seen shares rise 11% over the past month and over 43% during the past six months. The stock has also risen 70% from its 52-week low of \u20b9530. LIC shares surged 12% in November and 22% in December last year after Chairman Siddhartha Mohanty told news agency PTI that he is optimistic about achieving double-digit growth in new business premiums in the financial year 2024.New business premium (NBP) is the premium, which is due on policy in the first year of a life insurance contract or a single lump sum payment from the policyholder.LIC has now become India's most valuable PSU, overtaking the State Bank of India . LIC's current market capitalisation stands at \u20b95.75 lakh crore, compared to SBI's \u20b95.64 lakh crore.One must note though, that LIC operates on a very low float in the market as the government still holds a 96% stake in the company. The government had divested only a 3.5% stake at the time of its IPO in May 2022, which is to date, the country's largest public issue.Since listing, the stock has not re-tested either its retail IPO price of \u20b9904 or the original IPO price of \u20b9949. Retail shareholders and LIC policyholders were given a discount of \u20b945 per share and \u20b960 per share, respectively. Policyholders were given shares at \u20b9889 per share.\u201cLIC is going to be among the top eight most profitable companies in India in the next 2 years and it\u2019s a business that is worth keeping for a longer time and it will get revalue as more information starts to be available,\" Deepak Shenoy of CapitalMind told CNBC-TV18 on December 18.Brokerage firm Kotak Institutional Equities had written in a note in December that the hype around LIC can be attributed to the hype around its non-par product Jeevan Utsav. Back then, the brokerage had called the valuation of LIC \"inexpensive,\" thereby providing big headroom. Therefore, it retained its \"buy\" recommendation on the stock with a price target of \u20b91,040.\"LIC started its journey on a very weak note with about 40% correction since its listing. However, over the past few months, it managed to change its downtrend after the formation of higher highs and higher lows. It witnessed a swing breakout above \u20b9750 levels which propelled the stock towards \u20b9900 levels. The next hurdle is placed at 920 which once crossed and sustained can push the stock towards \u20b91,100 levels,\" Gaurav Bissa of InCred Equities said.Shares of LIC are trading 1.8% higher at \u20b9908.30.",

            "text": "Life insurers reported 48 per cent year-on-year (Y-o-Y) growth in new business premium (NBP) in February on the back of the strong increase shown by Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC), coupled with robust performance by private insurers.\n\nAccording to the data released by Life Insurance Council, the NBP of life insurance companies came in at Rs 33,913.18 crore, 48.43 per cent higher than the Rs 22,847.65 crore in the year-ago period.\n\nWhile LIC\u2019s premium rose by 67.48 per cent to Rs 19,896.01 crore as compared to Rs 11,879.49 crore in the same period a year earlier, private life insurance companies reported 27.80 growth to Rs 14,017.17 crore from Rs 10,968.16 crore.\n\nNBP is the premium of life insurance companies from new policies for a particular year. It is the sum of the first-year premium and single premium, reflecting the total from new businesses.\n\nLIC witnessed growth because of a surge in group single premium. It is the largest player in the group single-premium market. The group single premium of the company nearly doubled to Rs 14,661.31 crore. Meanwhile, even as private insurers lead in the individual segment they posted healthy growth across segments.\n\nAmong large private players, the premium of the largest private life insurer, SBI Life, grew around 32 per cent to Rs 2,648.86 crore.\n\nMeanwhile, other private-sector players posted healthy growth. HDFC Life\u2019s NBP rose by 14.49 per cent to Rs 2,602.11 crore and ICICI Prudential Life Insurance\u2019s increased 32.54 per cent to Rs 1,763.33 crore.\n\nThe NBP of Bajaj Allianz Life grew by 12.92 per cent to Rs 1,050.04 crore and Max Life Insurance\u2019s climbed around 51 per cent to Rs 1,097.09 crore.\n\nAccording to experts, usually the February-March period is important for insurance companies typically because customers buy policies and products for tax saving by late January or in February. This is likely to have led to the growth.\n\nIn April-February FY24, the NBP of life insurers slipped 0.22 per cent Y-o-Y to more than Rs 3.17 trillion as compared to above Rs 3.18 trillion in the same period of the previous year. LIC\u2019s premium dropped 8.35 per cent to above Rs 2.03 trillion whereas private insurers\u2019 grew by 14.09 per cent Y-o-Y to more than Rs 1.15 trillion.",

The company is expected to post steady numbers, led by a healthy growth in new business premium, while APE (annual premium equivalent) growth is likely to be modest.Profit for the October-December period is seen rising up to 32% year-on-year to Rs 400 crore.Key monitorables for investors in the reporting December quarter include the commentary on growth, outlook on VNB margins, and possible talk on the changes in product mix.In the preceding September quarter SBI Life's net profit rose by a marginal 0.8% to Rs 380 crore and net premium income increased 22% year-on-year to Rs 20,050 crore.Here's what brokerages expect from SBI Life's Q3New business premiums to report steady growth QoQ. APE growth to remain robust QOQ, aided by NPAR and annuity products. VNB Margins likely to remain range bound between 28-29%.Growth in New business premium to remain healthy. Cost leadership to continue. Expect VNB growth to remain healthy, while margins to show a modest growth. Expect protection mix to improve and Non-PAR to remain healthy.We expect moderate 13% year-on-year APE growth for SBI Life in 3QFY24E. We expect margins to remain flat sequentially at 29%, as the product mix has stabilized after changes in the budget.We pencil in new business growth assumptions based on trends observed till November 2023, when SBI Life had displayed NBP/APE de-growth of -29%/-11% for 2M3QFY24 (October and November 2023). We pencil in VNB margin to remain stable QoQ based on expected business mix.",
