Allied Bank\u2019s exchange company will be named ABL Exchange Company (Private) Limited and MCB\u2019s as MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

The first attack occurred at the Police Lines in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Tank district, where three policemen were killed and three others injured, while four militants were also killed.\n\nAuthorities said a terrorist blew himself up at the main entrance of the police office and residence block and the others stormed in. The attack was claimed by a new militant group, Ansarul Jihad, the report added.\n\nALSO READ: Pakistan: Financial strain hits PIA, 7,000 employees not paid November salaries\n\nMilitants also attacked the joint police and security forces check post in Nalla Bara tehsil in the Khyber tribal district, where two troops of the Frontier Constabulary were killed. At the same time, six people were also injured in the attack.\n\nThree days back, at least 23 soldiers were killed and more than 30 others injured after militants belonging to the Tehreek-i-Jihad Pakistan (TJP), a newly formed militant group that is an affiliate of the banned Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), stormed a compound used by the military in Dera Ismail Khan.\n\nOn 4 November, the TJP militants attacked the Pakistan Air Force's Mianwali Training Air Base, some 300 km from Lahore, damaging three grounded aircraft. The TJP terror outfit has been behind some major attacks in Pakistan and repeatedly attacked the security and military installations in Pakistan.\n\nIn September 2015, Taliban gunmen killed 29 people, including 16 worshippers in a mosque, when they stormed Badaber Air base, close to the northwestern city of Peshawar.\n\nIn May 2011, 15 terrorists belonging to TTP and Al Qaeda attacked PNS Mehran, the headquarters of the Pakistan Navy's Naval Air Arm, located in Sindh, and killed 18 military personnel and wounded 16. Two American-built surveillance aircraft were also destroyed.\n\nWith agency inputs.\n\nMilestone Alert!

The victims ran barber shops in the local market, police said, adding that they were abducted a day earlier and their bodies were recovered on Tuesday.\n\nThe incident took place in the Mir Ali area of the North Waziristan district of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province bordering Afghanistan, ARY News reported on Tuesday.\n\nNo one has claimed responsibility for the killings.\n\nThe latest incident comes after five labourers were killed in the same province by unidentified militants while they were in their tents. The province is battling with a worsening law and order situation due to the rising terrorism. Notably, the much-awaited countrywide elections are just over a month away.\n\nThe increase in terrorist acts - including attacks on military and police as well as targeted killings - is on the rise in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, especially the former tribal belt.\n\nHowever, the region around Bannu and Dera Ismail Khan has been worst affected.\n\nRecently, Pakistan has been hit by a wave of terrorist activities orchestrated by various terror outfits. According to a recent report by the Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies (PICSS) think tank, the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province was the most affected by terror attacks in November, recording 51 attacks with 54 deaths and 81 injuries.\n\n(With inputs from PTI)",

Some militants also opened fire and a shootout between them and security forces was still ongoing. Pakistani Taliban group has claimed responsibility for the attack.\n\nThe terrorists rammed an explosive-laden vehicle into the building of the police station, which was followed by a mortar attack.\n\nSome militants also opened fire and a shootout between them and security forces was still ongoing, police officer Kamal Khan said as quoted by Associated Press.\n\nDuring the shootout, the police also gunned down two terrorists during the gunfight, according ARY News channel, as reported by PTI.\n\nPolice officer Kamal Khan said that the attack took place in Dera Ismail Khan, a city in the Afghan border region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The province is a former stronghold of the militant Pakistani Taliban group, also known as Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, as reported by AP.\n\nMeanwhile, this is not the first time the province has witnessed violence. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has witnessed a rise in violence with several deadly attacks. Earlier in January 2023, at least 101 people were killed when a suicide bomber targeted a mosque in Peshawar.\n\nNo one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but suspicion is likely to fall on the Pakistani Taliban, who have stepped up attacks on security forces since 2022. Authorities say the insurgents have become emboldened while living openly in Afghanistan since the Taliban takeover of that country in 2021.\n\nThe TTP, though a separate group, is closely allied with the Afghan Taliban.\n\nDera Ismail Khan is located near South Waziristan, a former sanctuary for militants. Pakistan\u2019s army carried out multiple operations against militants there after some attacked an army-run school, killing more than 150 people, mostly school children, in 2014.\n\nMilestone Alert!

            "text": "A leader of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Shah Khalid, was shot dead by unidentified armed men in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Swabi, The News International reported on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the report, unidentified assailants riding a motorcycle fired shots at Khalid's car at Swabi Assa, resulting in the death of the Opposition leader on the spot.\n\nThe police added that the suspects who fired at the vehicle escaped unchallenged. However, the police have launched a search operation for them. The officials have yet to ascertain the motive behind the murder.\n\nThe incident comes hours after an election hopeful and two other people were shot dead in North Waziristan when unknown assailants opened fire on them, according to local police officials.\n\nWith the general elections drawing near, the menace of violence is rearing its head in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), as another local political leader was gunned down in the province over the past 24 hours, The News International reported.\n\nThe independent candidate, identified as Kaleemullah Khan, was looking at contesting the general elections from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly's PK-104 segment.\n\nIn a separate incident on the same day, Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz's (PML-N) candidate for NA-258 Aslam Buledi sustained injuries during a firing incident in Turbat City, officials said.\n\nThe deadly attacks on Opposition candidates and Independents come as the country gears up for the February 8 general elections.\n\nLast week, former member of the National Assembly and National Democratic Movement (NDM) leader, Mohsin Dawar's convoy came under attack by terrorists in Tappi village.\n\nThe News International reported that the convoy of Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam-Fazl (JUI-F) supremo Maulana Fazlur Rehman had also come under attack on December 31 in Dera Ismail Khan; however, he remained safe.\n\nPolitical leaders, including Fazl, have raised concerns and cast doubts over the staging of polls due to the \"unstable\" security situation in some parts of the province.\n\nPakistan has witnessed an alarming surge in terror incidents in the outgoing year, reaching the highest level since 2014.",
