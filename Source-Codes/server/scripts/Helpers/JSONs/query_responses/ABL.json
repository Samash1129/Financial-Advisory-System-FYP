This was disclosed in the Financial Results sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday (today).\n\nThis translates to an earnings per share (EPS) of Rs36.07, up from Rs18.56 in the previous year.\n\nIn response to the robust financial results, the Board of Directors at ABL has recommended a final cash dividend of Rs4 per share, which amounts to 40%.\n\nThis comes in addition to the interim dividends already distributed at Rs8 per share, totaling an 80% dividend payout for the year.\n\nA key driver of ABL\u2019s impressive performance has been its net interest income (NII), which rose by 69.26% year-on-year to Rs112.9 billion, up from Rs66.7 billion.\n\nThis increase is largely attributed to a 65.7% rise in interest-earning to Rs357 billion.\n\nThe bank also experienced growth in its total non-markup income, which increased by 19.33% to Rs25.6 billion.\n\nThis was buoyed by a significant 32.3% increase in fee, commission, and brokerage income, reaching Rs11.8 billion.\n\nAdditionally, dividend income and foreign exchange income saw increases of 14.8% and 15.3%, reaching Rs3.5 billion and Rs9.2 billion, respectively.\n\nHowever, ABL reported a 39.7% decrease in gains from the sale of securities, which stood at Rs844.8 million for the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the bank also reported a provision reversal of Rs2.98 billion in 2023, a positive shift from the provision expense of Rs260.9 million in 2022.\n\nOn the expenditure side, total non-markup expenses rose by 19.5% to Rs49.7 billion in 2023, from Rs41.6 billion in the preceding year.\n\nThis increase was primarily due to an 18.5% rise in operating expenses, which climbed to Rs47.7 billion.\n\nAdditionally, contributions to the Workers\u2019 Welfare Fund were also higher during the year.\n\nIn terms of taxation, ABL\u2019s tax payments witnessed a significant increase, totaling Rs45.5 billion, which is 78.2% higher than the previous year\u2019s payments.",

On the flip side, Mari Petroleum, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank, Habib Bank and Bank Alhabib Ltd lost value to weigh down on the index by 226 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 63,813.06 points after shedding 484.94 points or 0.75 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume further dipped by 10.39pc to 412.82 million shares. The traded value also plunged by 35.89pc to Rs16.18bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan International Airline Corporation Ltd (66.17m shares), K-Electric (47.10m shares), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (31.07m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (20.13m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (18.82m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Atlas Honda Ltd (Rs28.52), Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs25.42), JS Global Capital Ltd (Rs11.64), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs11.45) and JDW Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs10.00).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs400.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs82.29), Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs44.89), Siemens Pakistan Ltd (Rs32.01) and Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs25.00).\n\nForeign investors indulged in aggressive selling as they disposed of shares worth $10.05m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 27th, 2024",

            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange on Thursday made a new record as it crossed the psychological barrier of 67,000 points.\n\nThe index started the day at its highest-ever closing point of 66,547.78 points, which it had attained on Wednesday. The index continued that momentum into Thursday as it raced up 698.24 points to an intraday high of 67,246.02 points by noon. The index settled before closing the day 103.9 points lower at 67,142.12 points.\n\nThis is the exchange's highest-ever closing level. The index is up 61% from July 2023 and 12% in the last three months.\n\nContinuing the positive momentum from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, economic reforms led by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), progress on selling off the national flag carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), and other loss-making state-owned enterprises, hike in gas tariffs, all contributed towards investor confidence.\n\nInvestors strategically augmented their equity portfolios by acquiring blue-chip stocks across diverse sectors. Power, banking, and fertilizer sectors positively influenced the index, with Bank AL Habib Limited (BAHL), Engro (ENGRO), Muslim Commercial Bank (MCB), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), and Lucky Cement (LUCK) collectively contributing 208 points to the bourse which gained a cumulative 594.34 points.\n\nSimultaneously, profit-taking was observed in Systems Limited (SYS), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), and Service Industries Limited (SRVI), resulting in a cumulative loss of 31 points.\n\nBrokerage house Topline Securities said that Thursday's trading session saw robust activity, with over 421.02 million shares exchanged at the bourse, amounting to a total value of Rs16.1 billion.

            "text": "ABL announced earnings (PAT) today for the calendar year 2023 at Rs. 41.3 billion, depicting an increase of 94 percent YoY | 8 percent QoQ.\n\nAccording to Arif Habib Limited, this jump in overall earnings was mainly on the back of growth in total income. Along with the result, ABL announced a final dividend of Rs. 4/share (CY23: Rs. 12/share).\n\nALSO READ MSCI Adds 22 PSX Companies to Its Indices\n\nNet Interest Income of the bank settled at Rs. 32.3 billion during 4QCY23, increasing 52 percent YoY and 7 percent QoQ. With this, the total NII for CY23 went up to Rs. 112.9 billion, marking a 69 percent YoY jump. Interest earned saw a jump of 66 percent during CY23 while interest expense was up by 64 percent.\n\nNFI depicted an increase of 73 percent YoY | 47 percent QoQ during 4QCY23, taking CY23\u2019s total to Rs. 25.6 billion (+19 percent YoY). This jump in CY23 is primarily due to higher fee, FX, and dividend income which were up 32 percent YoY, 15 percent YoY, and 15 percent YoY, respectively. However, the gain on securities declined by 40 percent YoY during the same period, clocking in at Rs. 845 million.\n\nProvisioning for the bank clocked in at Rs. 445 million during 4QCY23 (4QCY22: Rs. 436 million) depicting an increase of 2 percent on a YoY basis. This takes total provisioning to Rs.~3 billion during CY23 (CY22 reversals: Rs. 261 million).\n\nThe bank\u2019s OPEX increased 6 percent YoY in 4QCY23 clocking in at Rs. 12.4 billion (4QCY22: Rs. 11.7 billion). With this, Cost/Income stood at 30.8 percent in 4QCY23 against 45.3 percent same period last year.\n\nThe effective tax rate was set at 57 percent during 4QCY23 compared to 50 percent last quarter. With this, the effective tax for CY23 stood at 52 percent (CY22: 55 percent).",

            "text": "Allied Bank Limited (ABL) posted its yearly financial results for CY23, declaring a final cash dividend of Rs4/share \u2013 taking the full-year payout to Rs12/share. The after-tax profits almost doubled year-on-year, despite an effective tax rate in excess of 50 percent. Volumetric expansion in asset base, improved deposit mix, and higher interest rates \u2013 all contributed towards the 92 percent year-on-year increase in after-tax profits.\n\nThe markup income soared 66 percent year-on-year, largely on the back of high variance in the average policy rate. Advances growth has been slow across the industry, given the overall macroeconomic situation \u2013 as evidenced by a 10 percent dip in gross advances over December 2022, by the end of September 2023. The ADR had dipped to under 45 percent by September end of 2023 and is likely to have stayed thereabouts, as one awaits the full-year balance sheet details.\n\nMost banks have resorted to improvement in deposit mix \u2013 in a bid to counter the cost of deposits in the face of the rising policy rate. ABL had reported an increase of 12 percent in deposit base to over Rs1.7 trillion as of September end, 2023. The current account growth outpaced all other categories \u2013 as the current account to total deposit inched up to 41 percent, and CASA went past 81 percent. The average cost of deposits is believed to have grown at a lesser pace than that of an increase in policy rate \u2013 owing to improved deposit mix.\n\nNon-funded income soared by a healthy 18 percent year-on-year, led by strong growth in fee and commission income. Foreign exchange income and dividend income also grew appreciably from last year. On the other hand, administrative expenses were kept largely in check at just 19 percent. This speaks volumes of the investment in efficient systems made in yesteryears by ABL \u2013 that seem to now be reaping the fruit \u2013 as the growth in administrative expenses stayed well below the average inflation rate for the year. The cost-to-income ratio, as a result, has improved significantly by over 10 percentage points \u2013 paving the way for a mammoth 84 percent year-on-year growth in pretax profit.\n\nPakistan\u2019s economy may well have come out of the rut and the worst may well be behind us \u2013 but nothing so far suggests a huge shift in fortune for the better \u2013 in 2024. The political stalemate and a very weak coalition government in the making \u2013 are already indicating hard times ahead. Not that ABL has relied heavily on private sector advances to seek profits, as other avenues remain conducive enough for record profits \u2013 year after year.",

            "text": "Why Choose a Foreign Currency Account?\n\nHaving a foreign currency account in Pakistan is considered a mark of wealth.\n\nA foreign currency account, or FCA, allows individuals and businesses to maintain their savings and transact in foreign currency.\n\nWith foreign currency, individuals and businesses can easily access international markets and expand operations across borders. This way, they not only diversify their currency but can also gain protection against market volatility.\n\nThis article particularly aims to give information about top banks in Pakistan that offer foreign currency accounts. Before we talk about banks, let's first discuss the key factors that must be considered while making your selection.\n\nFactors to Consider in Choosing a Bank for a Foreign Currency Account\n\nThe selection of the right bank for opening a foreign currency account is crucial. In general, the right bank is the one that suits your business or individual requirements. Specifically, you should keep the following points in mind while selecting the bank for your foreign currency account.\n\nAvailable Foreign Currency Options\n\nEvery bank offers a range of foreign currencies for your FCA. Choose the one that best meets your financial objectives and business needs. Preferably, go for the one that offers a wide range of currencies.\n\nOnline Banking Service\n\nAlthough every bank offers online banking services, your choice should be evaluated in terms of ease of access and security protocols. The online platform must be user-friendly and convenient without any compromise on data safety and transaction security.\n\nService Charges\n\nEvaluate the costs charged by the bank as service charges or transaction fees. These charges can significantly enhance your cost of maintaining a foreign currency account. Therefore, it is recommended to assess and compare the fees and make sure that there are no hidden charges.\n\nTransaction Limits\n\nEvery bank offers a different set of transaction limits for different types of accounts. Either you cannot exceed the transaction limit or exceeding may incur extra charges. Therefore, you should know about the transaction limits to manage your business settlements and avoid any extra charges.\n\nBranch and ATM Accessibility\n\nAccessibility is one of the most important factors. Ensure the branch is within your reach and ATMs are easily available, to avoid any hassle in case there is a sudden need for funds.\n\nCustomer Assistance\n\nThe way the bank deals with its customers matters for your peace of mind. Assess the quality of customer service and available customer support channels, as for many account-related issues, you don\u2019t necessarily need to visit the branch. Instead, they can be easily sorted out via email or phone call.\n\nRegulatory Compliance\n\nThe most important of all factors is to ensure regulatory compliance of the bank with the relevant regulatory authorities, specifically with the State Bank of Pakistan. Don\u2019t opt if there is any doubt about the legal conformity of the bank; otherwise, you may end up putting your account at risk.\n\nInterest Rates\n\nIn case you are going to open a savings foreign currency account, it is recommended to check and compare interest rates offered by different banks. A higher interest rate will obviously give a better return on your savings.\n\nSupplementary Services\n\nSome banks also offer certain investment plans on easy terms and conditions. It is recommended to evaluate if the offered plans help in achieving your financial objectives. If yes, then you should take advantage of the opportunity.\n\nBanks Offering Foreign Currency Accounts in Pakistan\n\nMany banks in Pakistan offer the facility of foreign currency accounts. Each bank is distinct in its range of features and services for different kinds of customers. Let's have a look at some of the banks that are best known for their services in offering foreign currency accounts in Pakistan.\n\nStandard Chartered Bank\n\nStandard Chartered Bank is well known for its state-of-the-art international banking services. It provides foreign currency accounts in a wide range of foreign currencies including USD, EUR, and GBP. The most enticing thing about Standard Chartered Bank is its highly user-friendly online platform for easy account management. Being a bank with a high reputation, its fees may be relatively high.\n\nHabib Bank Limited (HBL)\n\nBeing one of the oldest and most well-established banks, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) provides a wide range of both current and foreign currency savings accounts. Habib Bank Limited is well-known for its large network of branches and ATMs throughout the country and abroad. Moreover, they offer an easily available and excellent customer support service.\n\nMCB Bank\n\nMuslim Commercial Bank offers foreign account services in multiple currencies as per the business needs of corporations or individuals. Their online banking system is quite user-friendly, allowing account holders to easily manage their accounts.\n\nUnited Bank Limited (UBL)\n\nUBL allows its customers to effectively manage their international transactions through the cutting-edge foreign currency accounts services. UBL allows easy account management with its online banking and a wide network of branches and ATMs.\n\nAllied Bank Limited (ABL)\n\nAllied Bank Limited specializes in offering foreign currency accounts in USD, GBP, and EUR. The accounts are specifically designed to fulfill its customers\u2019 business and individual requirements. ABL also has a wide network of branches and ATMs across Pakistan, making it easy to access.\n\nMeezan Bank\n\nMeezan Bank is distinct in its offering of foreign currency accounts compliant with Islamic Shariah law. So, if you have any reservations about interest-based accounts or investments, Meezan Bank is the right option for you. Here you can find the right FCA options without any questions on Islamic beliefs. Meezan Bank also has a good network of branches all over Pakistan.\n\nAlthough this article has covered some critical factors, it is important to visit your bank of choice for specific details about accounts, fees, and other details.\n\nConclusion\n\nConsidering the above factors will help you make the right selection of bank for your foreign currency accounts.

However, the news of some progress on the formation of a PDM-style government boosted market sentiments and helped the index to recover the lost ground gaining 589.34 points to 61,654.65 intraday.\n\nThe market opened on a negative trend where mainly Oil and Gas Development Company and Pakistan Petroleum opened at the lower lock on the back of the news that IMF is not on board with the energy ministry\u2019s tariff rationalisation and circular debt management plan.\n\nSimilarly, the cement sector witnessed a resurgence, with Pioneer Cement Ltd, Maple Leaf Cement and Fauji Cement Company registering gains of 3.19pc, 3.09pc, and 2.98pc, respectively, culminating in a positive close.\n\nAllied Bank Ltd announced its 2023 result, where the bank posted earnings per share of Rs36.07 and a cash payout of Rs4 per share.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said stocks showed recovery after MSCI, a provider of global indices for passive investments, added 19 companies to its Frontier Small Cap Index in its latest quarterly index review.\n\nHe said the reports of IMF\u2019s disapproval of the caretaker government\u2019s proposals for power tariff rationalisation and resolve of circular debt crises did dent the market sentiments.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 61,226.93 points after adding 161.61 points or 0.26 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan K-Electric (65.82m shares), WorldCall Tele\u00adcom Ltd (30.09m shares), Pakistan Refinery Ltd (28.60m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (18.64m shares) and Cnergyico PK Ltd (18.12m shares).\n\nForeign investors remained net buyers as they picked shares worth $0.17m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 14th, 2024",

            "text": "In 2023, the banking industry performed exceptionally well. It set new benchmarks and exceeded historical highs. One of the key highlights was the significant increase in dividends, rising by an amazing 84% compared to the previous year.\n\nWith outstanding price performance, the banking sector outperformed the PSX in 2023, achieving an amazing 85 percent return as opposed to the index\u2019s 55 percent. The industry\u2019s profitability enjoyed record-breaking growth.\n\nArif Habib Limited reports that a notable 85 percent YoY growth in interest income was the primary driver of the notable jump in profitability. The policy rate rising by 600 basis points and the year-over-year growth in deposits are two of the reasons for this increase.\n\nRegretfully, banks\u2019 involvement in funding the private sector is still restricted to boosting the real sector\u2019s GDP. Because of this, most banks had record-breaking profits in the previous year and made significant contributions to the national coffers due to their many tax payments, which also resulted in historically high values.\n\nRead More: CDA Mandates Capital\u2019s Hotels to Install Eco-friendly Waste Disposal Plants\n\nIn order to increase their bottom-line revenue, banks intend to create distinct subsidiaries to boost their foreign exchange operations.\n\nThe top ten profitable banks in Pakistan are as follows:\n\n1. Meezan Bank\n\nMeezan continued to be Pakistan\u2019s most profitable bank. Being the premier Islamic bank, it posted an astonishing profit of Rs. 84.5 billion in 2023 compared to Rs. 45 billion in 2022, indicating an 87 percent year-over-year increase.\n\nAt the end of the year, the bank had reached a number of significant milestones, with deposits and assets totaling Rs. 2 trillion and Rs. 3 trillion, respectively. The bank expanded its nationwide network as well, adding more than 1,000 locations and ATMs. A total dividend of Rs. 28 per share was also paid to the bank\u2019s stockholders. Additionally, the value of the shares rose from 25.1 to 47.1 during the reviewed year.\n\nUnfortunately, Sukuk\u2019s extremely limited function in providing funding to support enterprises and entrepreneurs continues to be the bank\u2019s primary priority.\n\n2. MCB Bank\n\nMCB Bank continued to hold the second spot. Its profitability increased tremendously by 89 percent to Rs. 65.3 billion in 2022 from Rs. 34.45 billion in 2022. Additionally, the bank raised its ownership of 81 percent in the asset management company, which made a substantial profit contribution. In contrast to the previous year\u2019s reported EPS of Rs. 27.6, the earnings per share climbed to Rs. 50.1. The bank gave stockholders dividends of Rs. 21 per share.\n\n3. Habib Bank Limited\n\nIn 2023, Habib Bank Limited recorded its greatest profit of Rs. 57.8 billion, a 68 percent increase over the previous year. The bank\u2019s assets and deposits reached above Rs. 5 trillion and Rs. 4.1 trillion, respectively, its highest-ever levels. In 2023, earnings per share was Rs. 39.32, up from Rs. 23.23 in 2022. The bank gave its stockholder\u2019s dividend payments of Rs. 9.25 per share.\n\nIn order to take advantage of new business prospects in the agri-economy, the bank expanded its operations in the agriculture sector by establishing a new specialized subsidiary. Other banks are expected to follow suit. By turning the Pakistan Super League into a national brand, the bank\u2019s leadership upheld its heritage of aiding the country\u2019s interests. Additionally, by giving the IT sector more influence, it advanced the development of Tech Destination Pakistan.\n\nRead More: SBP Reserves up Marginally to $8.05 Billion\n\n4. United Bank Limited\n\nWith a 74 percent increase over the same period last year, United Bank Limited announced its highest-ever year profit after tax of Rs. 56.47 billion in 2023. The bank continued to be generous in its dividend payments to stockholders; in one calendar year, the highest payout amount was Rs. 44 per share. In a year, the bank\u2019s share value rose from 25.4 to 47. By the end of 2023, the bank\u2019s deposits had nearly reached Rs. 2.2 trillion, and its assets had increased to over Rs. 5 trillion. The bank\u2019s management began working hard that same year to establish its currency exchange operation. Like in 2022, the bank remained in fourth place in 2023.\n\n5. National Bank of Pakistan\n\nThe National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) experienced a significant increase in profitability as well, with its bottom line reaching a record-breaking Rs. 53.3 billion. When compared to the previous year\u2019s earnings of Rs. 30.9 billion, the bank\u2019s profit increased by 72%.\n\nThe bank\u2019s assets increased to more than Rs 6.5 trillion, the biggest amount ever seen in the nation\u2019s banking sector. It now has about Rs. 3.6 trillion in deposits. By the end of 2023, the bank\u2019s earnings per share had likewise increased to 24.96. Regretfully, no dividend announcement was made to shareholders by the bank. Regarding the most profitable banks in Pakistan, the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) remained ranked fifth.\n\n6. Standard Chartered Bank\n\nOut of all the major banks, Standard Chartered Bank had the highest profit growth, rising by 115% year over year. From an all-time high profit of Rs. 19.8 billion in 2022 to Rs. 45.6 billion in 2023, the bank\u2019s profitability increased.\n\nThe bank\u2019s assets now total over Rs. 1 trillion, marking a significant accomplishment. Additionally, deposits increased to Rs. 720 billion. Additionally, the bank\u2019s earnings per share increased by over 100%, from 5.1 to 11. The bank moved up one spot to become Pakistan\u2019s sixth most profitable bank.\n\n7.

Bank Alfalah\n\nThe bank reported a profit after tax of Rs. 36.456 billion, up almost 100% from Rs. 18.206 billion in the previous year. The earnings per share (EPS) has increased from Rs. 10.27 to Rs. 23.12. In 2023, it distributed a total dividend of Rs. 8 per share.\n\nThe bank has established a digitally-enabled lifestyle banking branch. Additionally, it bought more than 7% of the shares in a BNPL company. The bank has achieved two noteworthy benchmarks: one trillion rupees in deposits and one thousand branches.\n\n9. Bank Al Habib\n\nIn 2023, Bank Al Habib recorded a respectable 113% increase in profits. The bank\u2019s profit in 2023 was Rs. 35.3 billion, up from the biggest profit the firm had ever declared in 2022 of Rs. 16.5 billion. The bank\u2019s earnings per share increased as well, reaching 31.7. Throughout the year, the bank gave its stockholders dividends of Rs. 14 per share. In 2023, the bank remained ranked in relation to the previous year.\n\n10. Habib Metro Bank\n\nComparing the Rs. 14.92 billion reported in 2022 to the Rs. 25.2 billion recorded in 2023, Habib Metro Bank also declared its highest-ever profit. The bank\u2019s earnings per share increased to Rs. 23.4 as well. Additionally, stockholders received a notable increase in dividends of Rs. 10.50 per share. The bank was given permission to establish an exchange company as a subsidiary, just like its rival banks.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn 2023, the top 10 banks on the list from the previous year did not change. Surprisingly, the majority of banks held onto their profits positions, with the exception of Standard Chartered Bank and Allied Bank, which moved up from sixth to seventh place, respectively.\n\nThe profit differential between the most profitable bank and the second-most profitable bank is substantial. Several rival banks, including Bank of Punjab, Habib Metro Bank, and Faysal Bank, lost their rankings on this list.\n\nUnusually, in 2024, the profits of two banks\u2014HBL and UBL\u2014showed growth in the face of increased competition. Banks are expected to continue growing their profits in 2024, even with a high policy rate regime. Banks that prioritize diversifying their sources of income and utilizing technology will have an advantage over their competitors in terms of profitability.\n\nFor more news, visit the Al Sadat Marketing Website.",

            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) staged a dramatic turnaround after plunging over 1,450 points in the opening few minutes of trading on Tuesday after it was learnt that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was not onboard with the government\u2019s circular debt plan.\n\nAfter falling below the 60,000 level during the opening hours of trading to hit an intra-day low of 59,613.17 \u2013 a fall of over 1,450 points - the KSE-100 began its recovery.\n\nAt close, the benchmark index settled at 61,226.93, an increase of 161.61 points or 0.26%.\n\nIndex-heavy energy stocks including OGDC, PPL, PSO and SNGP, however, were still in the red.\n\nThe earlier negativity came after the IMF said the interim government\u2019s tariff rationalisation and circular debt management plans do not address the underlying problems of Pakistan\u2019s energy sector.\n\n\u201cRestoring the viability of the energy sector is critical to Pakistan\u2019s economic recovery and fiscal sustainability,\u201d IMF Mission Chief Nathan Porter told Business Recorder via message on Monday.\n\n\u201cFor this, it is essential for the government to focus on broad-based reforms, including to reduce the high cost of energy, improve compliance and reduce theft and line losses, end captive power, and fix the governance and management of the DISCOs, as well as keep up with regular tariff adjustments.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the proposed plan does not address the underlying problems. In particular, the circular debt neutrality of the tariff rationalisation plan is doubtful and it would place a significant additional burden on vulnerable households.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarket was expecting a big dividend due to this,\u201d said Mohammed Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, in a note.\n\nExperts said the market\u2019s downward trajectory was led by OGDC and PPL in addition to political uncertainty that dampened sentiment as formation of a coalition government was seemingly still away from being finalised.\n\nAfter its recovery, an analyst said strong corporate showing is driving the index upwards.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is no positive development on the economic front, strong corporate results are acting as a support factor,\u201d Sana Tawfik, an analyst at AHL, told Business Recorder.\n\nOn the corporate front, Allied Bank Limited posted a profit growth of nearly 95% during 2023, as compared to the preceding year.\n\nMeanwhile, others were of the view that the recovery comes over market expectations of the formation of a coalition government soon.\n\n\u201cThe recovery comes amid hope that soon a coalition government will take charge, and things will be smooth,\u201d Sohail told Business Recorder later during trading.\n\nOn Monday, the wider market had shrugged off a post on Sunday evening by the Petroleum Division, Ministry of Energy with index-heavy OGDC and PPL deep in the red, dragging the KSE-100 with selling pressure also due to political uncertainty after the General Elections.\n\nAt close, the KSE-100 settled at 61,065.31, down 1,878.43 points or 2.98%. This was the lowest closing of the benchmark index since December 27, 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, the rupee registered a marginal increase of 0.01% against the US dollar in the inter-bank market. At close, the local unit settled at 279.31 after a gain of Re0.02 against the greenback, as per the State Bank of Pakistan.\n\nVolume on the all-share index increased to 435.5 million from 350 million a session ago.\n\nThe value of shares rose to Rs15.97 billion from Rs12.74 billion in the previous session.\n\nK-Electric Ltd was the volume leader with 65.8 million shares, followed by WorldCall Telecom with 30.1 million shares, and Pak Refinery with 28.6 million shares.\n\nShares of 355 companies were traded on Tuesday, of which 188 registered an increase, 139 recorded a fall, while 28 remained unchanged.",
