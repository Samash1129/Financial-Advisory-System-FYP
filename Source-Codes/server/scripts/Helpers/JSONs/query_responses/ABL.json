This was disclosed in the Financial Results sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday (today).\n\nThis translates to an earnings per share (EPS) of Rs36.07, up from Rs18.56 in the previous year.\n\nIn response to the robust financial results, the Board of Directors at ABL has recommended a final cash dividend of Rs4 per share, which amounts to 40%.\n\nThis comes in addition to the interim dividends already distributed at Rs8 per share, totaling an 80% dividend payout for the year.\n\nA key driver of ABL\u2019s impressive performance has been its net interest income (NII), which rose by 69.26% year-on-year to Rs112.9 billion, up from Rs66.7 billion.\n\nThis increase is largely attributed to a 65.7% rise in interest-earning to Rs357 billion.\n\nThe bank also experienced growth in its total non-markup income, which increased by 19.33% to Rs25.6 billion.\n\nThis was buoyed by a significant 32.3% increase in fee, commission, and brokerage income, reaching Rs11.8 billion.\n\nAdditionally, dividend income and foreign exchange income saw increases of 14.8% and 15.3%, reaching Rs3.5 billion and Rs9.2 billion, respectively.\n\nHowever, ABL reported a 39.7% decrease in gains from the sale of securities, which stood at Rs844.8 million for the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the bank also reported a provision reversal of Rs2.98 billion in 2023, a positive shift from the provision expense of Rs260.9 million in 2022.\n\nOn the expenditure side, total non-markup expenses rose by 19.5% to Rs49.7 billion in 2023, from Rs41.6 billion in the preceding year.\n\nThis increase was primarily due to an 18.5% rise in operating expenses, which climbed to Rs47.7 billion.\n\nAdditionally, contributions to the Workers\u2019 Welfare Fund were also higher during the year.\n\nIn terms of taxation, ABL\u2019s tax payments witnessed a significant increase, totaling Rs45.5 billion, which is 78.2% higher than the previous year\u2019s payments.",

Along with the result, ABL announced a final dividend of Rs. 4/share (CY23: Rs. 12/share).\n\nALSO READ MSCI Adds 22 PSX Companies to Its Indices\n\nNet Interest Income of the bank settled at Rs. 32.3 billion during 4QCY23, increasing 52 percent YoY and 7 percent QoQ. With this, the total NII for CY23 went up to Rs. 112.9 billion, marking a 69 percent YoY jump. Interest earned saw a jump of 66 percent during CY23 while interest expense was up by 64 percent.\n\nNFI depicted an increase of 73 percent YoY | 47 percent QoQ during 4QCY23, taking CY23\u2019s total to Rs. 25.6 billion (+19 percent YoY). This jump in CY23 is primarily due to higher fee, FX, and dividend income which were up 32 percent YoY, 15 percent YoY, and 15 percent YoY, respectively. However, the gain on securities declined by 40 percent YoY during the same period, clocking in at Rs. 845 million.\n\nProvisioning for the bank clocked in at Rs. 445 million during 4QCY23 (4QCY22: Rs. 436 million) depicting an increase of 2 percent on a YoY basis. This takes total provisioning to Rs.~3 billion during CY23 (CY22 reversals: Rs. 261 million).\n\nThe bank\u2019s OPEX increased 6 percent YoY in 4QCY23 clocking in at Rs. 12.4 billion (4QCY22: Rs. 11.7 billion). With this, Cost/Income stood at 30.8 percent in 4QCY23 against 45.3 percent same period last year.\n\nThe effective tax rate was set at 57 percent during 4QCY23 compared to 50 percent last quarter. With this, the effective tax for CY23 stood at 52 percent (CY22: 55 percent).",

The after-tax profits almost doubled year-on-year, despite an effective tax rate in excess of 50 percent. Volumetric expansion in asset base, improved deposit mix, and higher interest rates \u2013 all contributed towards the 92 percent year-on-year increase in after-tax profits.\n\nThe markup income soared 66 percent year-on-year, largely on the back of high variance in the average policy rate. Advances growth has been slow across the industry, given the overall macroeconomic situation \u2013 as evidenced by a 10 percent dip in gross advances over December 2022, by the end of September 2023. The ADR had dipped to under 45 percent by September end of 2023 and is likely to have stayed thereabouts, as one awaits the full-year balance sheet details.\n\nMost banks have resorted to improvement in deposit mix \u2013 in a bid to counter the cost of deposits in the face of the rising policy rate. ABL had reported an increase of 12 percent in deposit base to over Rs1.7 trillion as of September end, 2023. The current account growth outpaced all other categories \u2013 as the current account to total deposit inched up to 41 percent, and CASA went past 81 percent. The average cost of deposits is believed to have grown at a lesser pace than that of an increase in policy rate \u2013 owing to improved deposit mix.\n\nNon-funded income soared by a healthy 18 percent year-on-year, led by strong growth in fee and commission income. Foreign exchange income and dividend income also grew appreciably from last year. On the other hand, administrative expenses were kept largely in check at just 19 percent. This speaks volumes of the investment in efficient systems made in yesteryears by ABL \u2013 that seem to now be reaping the fruit \u2013 as the growth in administrative expenses stayed well below the average inflation rate for the year. The cost-to-income ratio, as a result, has improved significantly by over 10 percentage points \u2013 paving the way for a mammoth 84 percent year-on-year growth in pretax profit.\n\nPakistan\u2019s economy may well have come out of the rut and the worst may well be behind us \u2013 but nothing so far suggests a huge shift in fortune for the better \u2013 in 2024. The political stalemate and a very weak coalition government in the making \u2013 are already indicating hard times ahead. Not that ABL has relied heavily on private sector advances to seek profits, as other avenues remain conducive enough for record profits \u2013 year after year.",

Despite the decline, Bank Al-Falah declared an interim cash dividend of Rs2.0 per share.\n\nEarnings per share (EPS) were reported at Rs6.31, down from RS6.83 per share year-on-year.\n\nThe financial statement highlighted a robust increase in interest income, which soared to Rs128.652 billion from Rs75.600 billion in the same quarter of the previous year. Conversely, interest expenses also surged to Rs97.785 billion, up from Rs27.913 billion.\n\nThe higher tax bill, which rose to Rs9.886 billion from Rs8.258 billion, was noted as a key factor impacting the bank's profit margins for the quarter.\n\nThe bank\u2019s non-markup Income (NMI) also rose by 19.51 percent year-on-year to Rs8.08 billion, owing to a significant rise in fee and commission income, foreign exchange income, and gain from derivatives to clock in at Rs4.53 billion, Rs2.3 billion and Rs297.55 million, respectively.\n\nOn the expense side, the total non-interest expenses increased by 26.71 percent year-on-year to Rs19.16 billion in 3QFY24 compared to Rs15.12 billion in 3QFY23.\n\nThe increase was attributed to the massive jump of 25.92 percent year-on-year in operating expenses from Rs14.71 billion in 3QFY23 to Rs18.52 billion in 3QFY24.\n\nABL\u2019s first-quarter profit jumps 51pc to Rs11.6 billion\n\nAllied Bank Limited (ABL) announced a robust 51 percent increase in its first-quarter net profit, driven by a surge in interest earned income.\n\nIn a statement released to the Pakistan Stock Exchange, the bank reported a net profit of Rs11.606 billion for the quarter ending March 31, 2024, compared to Rs7.684 billion during the same period last year.\n\nThe bank also announced an interim cash dividend of Rs4.0 a share.

            "short_description": "UBank\u2019s strategy makes a sharp U-turn  Profit by Pakistan Today",
            "text": "The long-anticipated financial statements of U Microfinance Banks (UBank) have finally emerged, albeit with a slight delay. After unveiling the half-yearly report on December 1, 2023, UBank quickly followed up with the financial statements for the nine months ending in September. The recently revealed statements have answered some questions about previous speculations that were making rounds. But on the whole, the statements have sparked intrigue across the financial realm.\n\nThis is because the bank seems to have taken a sharp U-turn from its unconventional approach, labelled as overly aggressive, which led to an astonishing threefold growth in its balance sheet amidst industry turmoil in 2022. Instead, a noticeable change has emerged: the bank has witnessed a sharp decrease in investments in government securities and mutual funds on the asset side and a significant reduction in borrowing on the liabilities side.\n\nMore alarmingly, the equity of UBank declined from around Rs 7 billion to Rs 5 billion in these nine months. Is there a possibility that UBank, which was once touted as one of the biggest microfinance banks, might not remain the biggest microfinance bank if its balance sheet continues to shrink?\n\nProfit examines Ubank\u2019s financial statements to make sense of what has changed at the bank.\n\nUBank\u2019s growth strategy\n\nFirst, to understand why the new statements are such a shock, let\u2019s recap UBank\u2019s previous aggressive strategy.\n\nThis approach was spearheaded by Kabeer Naqvi, the chief executive officer at UBank up until October 2023. In an earlier conversation with Profit, he said, \u201cI am building relationships with banks. And over time, they will start lending to me against my advances rather than government-backed securities. One or two banks are already comfortable enough with us to start doing this.\u201d\n\nRead: Has UBank cracked the code to make a microfinance bank profitable?\n\nWhat did he mean by this?\n\nRead: Grow your company size by 3 to 6 times in just months. At least two Pakistani companies have done this & you can too. Here is how\n\nUBank essentially increased the size of its balance sheet using a quid pro quo arrangement. The financial statements of 2022 reveal that a major chunk of deposits was from banks and other financial institutions. These deposits were in a sort of give-and-take arrangement, where any funds received from a financial institution were funnelled right back into the same institution or its associated asset management company. Furthermore, these deposited funds were heavily concentrated, ranging from 25% to a staggering 77% of the fund\u2019s assets.\n\nRead: A sneak peek into the deposit growth of U Microfinance Bank\n\nWhile UBank\u2019s credit rating flagged this concentration risk, it did not acknowledge UBank as the primary investor in these funds. So what was happening?\n\nFinancial institutions such as Faysal Asset Management, NBP Funds, and Allied Bank Limited seemed to orchestrate a method to inflate their balance sheets and consequently UBank\u2019s. This involved a complex process of depositing funds, purchasing securities, and pledging these securities back to the same banks or third-party entities, effectively allowing UBank to borrow more against these treasury bills (T-bills) and perpetuate the cycle.\n\nThis cycle continued, spinning a web of financial manoeuvring that enabled the size of the balance sheet to grow by a factor of three. Investments increased to Rs 137 billion (Rs 13,733 crore) from Rs 46.5 billion. At the same time, UBank\u2019s borrowings increased from 36.8 billion in 2021 to Rs 115 billion (restated). And deposits increased from Rs 55 billion to Rs 92 billion.\n\nNaqvi clarified UBank\u2019s investment approach, emphasising the utilisation of shorter-term instruments to capitalise on increasing interest rates. By borrowing at a fixed rate for a longer duration and investing in shorter-tenor instruments, they aimed to leverage interest rate fluctuations to their advantage.\n\nUBank\u2019s method, while aggressive and unique in the microfinance banking sector, aimed to mitigate advance book risks by borrowing heavily from banks and actively managing their necessary investments.\n\nAnd even if the bank made some loss on treasury operations due to unforeseen economic circumstances, for example, the logic was that his board and shareholders should still be happy as he was successfully securing the bank against a liquidity crisis.\n\nSharp U-turn\n\nA significant shift occurred in UBank\u2019s strategy in the nine months of 2023. The bank seemingly reversed its highly leveraged approach, experiencing a substantial decline in both investments and borrowings, impacting its future profitability.\n\nThe sharp decline in both investments and borrowings is almost matched 1 to 1. Borrowings have decreased by 58% from Rs 115 billion to Rs 49 billion. Similarly, investments have decreased by 56% from Rs 137 billion to Rs 61 billion. This means that the growth engine ((leveraged investment portfolio) is being unwound at a fast pace.\n\nNotes in the financial statements reveal that UBank has sold off all T-bills valued at around Rs 55 billion at the end of December 2022 in its possession. Moreover, investments in mutual funds have also declined from around Rs 22 billion in December 2022, to around Rs 7 billion at the end of September 2023.\n\nAccording to the annual report of 2022, UBank held mutual funds with Allied Bank Limited.\n\nOn the borrowing side, the biggest drop is in borrowings from MCB Bank Limited (MCB): from Rs30 billion in 2022 to zero at the end of June 2023. According to notes in financial statements, these borrowings were secured against mutual funds units and Pakistan investment bond (PIB) or T-bills to be kept in an investor portfolio securities account maintained with MCB.\n\nBorrowings from Allied Bank Limited (ABL) have also declined by around Rs15 billion. This loan was again secured against ABL asset management units and PIBs or T-bills kept in IPS account managed with ABL. Both MCB and ABL are old banks that are considered to be more risk-averse.\n\nBorrowings from Meezan Bank also witnessed a decline of around Rs3 billion, which were again secured against government securities.\n\nRepo borrowing has declined by a whopping 85%, from approximately Rs 30 billion in 2022 to around Rs 4.5 billion at the end of September 2023.\n\nInterestingly, while other banks were withdrawing their finances, JS Bank extended a term finance facility of around Rs 2 billion. When asked for comments, the bank responded that the finance facility from the bank is still intact but from the asset management company (AMC) side has been withdrawn. Interestingly, UBank had only borrowed funds from the bank \u2013 so what AMC funds is this source talking about?\n\nAccording to the VIS credit report of March 31, 2023, UBank had a high concentration risk. The top five depositors are asset managers NBP Financial Sector Income Fund (NBP FSIF), Faysal Income and Growth Fund (Faysal IGF), JS Microfinance Fund (MICR), followed by the two banks Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and Faysal Bank. They comprise 38% of the Rs 92 billion deposit base, meaning that Rs 35 billion are deposited by these five financial institutions. That would translate into an average of Rs 7 billion per institution.\n\nThe VIS report highlighted that MICR is one of the biggest depositors of UBank. In other words, JS funds are the largest depositors of UBank, and UBank is the largest investor in JS Funds.\n\nAt least that was the case until March 2023. However, as per the source\u2019s comments, the funds have been withdrawn from the AMC side which means that JS funds have (possibly) withdrawn their deposits. UBank\u2019s investment in mutual funds has also decreased which could mean that UBank has also withdrawn its investments.\n\nAs per the September 2023 financial statement, the deposits have increased, but the report does not specifically mention which deposits have increased. However, the half-yearly reports of 2023 reveal a noteworthy shift in deposit trends. While deposits from banks and financial institutions still hold a significant part of the total deposits, individual deposits have surged impressively by approximately 87%, soaring from Rs 15 billion to Rs 28 billion. This surge has substantially increased the share of individual deposits within UBank\u2019s portfolio, climbing from 16% to a substantial 28%. Meanwhile, deposits from banks and financial institutions have slightly dropped by around 14%, decreasing from Rs 43 billion to Rs 37 billion during the initial half of 2023.\n\nEquity\n\nWhat\u2019s intriguing in these newly released financial statements is the restating of UBank\u2019s year-end figures for the concluded year of 2022. The statements offer surprising insights.\n\nThe equity figure stood at Rs 5.3 billion at the end of June 2023, which increased to around Rs 5.8 billion at the end of September 2023. For context, microfinance banks are supposed to maintain a minimum capital of Rs 1 billion as mandated by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP). The equity figure stands at five times the required amount, showcasing a significant surplus in comparison to the mandated threshold. Moreover, the bank reported an impressive Rs 1.7 billion in profit after tax in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nThe SBP had concerns regarding the treatment of rescheduled loans under the expected credit loss (ECL) model of the IFRS-9 and directed the Board of the Bank to take certain corrective measures including aligning the matters relating to the implementation of IFRS 9, and adjusting retrospectively the financial position as at December 31, 2022 and directing further that in case of shortfall in related statutory requirements, capital to be injected by the sponsors of the bank.\n\nConsequently, the 2022 financials were restated, which resulted in net profit of 2022 of Rs 2.25 billion, turning into a loss of Rs 539 million. Adjustments were also made to the balance sheet. Moreover, the PTCL group injected Rs 1.6 billion into UBank post the balance sheet date, to meet the shortfall in statutory capital.\n\nRead: UBank puts speculations to rest with healthy Rs5bn equity\n\nProfitability\n\nDuring the initial nine months of 2023, the bank managed to maintain its profitability, recording a profit after tax of Rs 1.7 billion. This achievement is noteworthy as it occurred despite a decrease in interest income derived from government securities. Simultaneously, there was a reduction in interest expenses linked to borrowings.\n\nAs per the deposit rate sheet of UBank, markup on deposits ranged between 5% and 24%, while earnings on markup ranged between 30% and 50% on the advance book. On average, this implies the bank maintains a spread of about 25%.\n\nDespite the decrease in government securities during the first three quarters, the net markup income has consistently fallen within the range of Rs 1.6 billion to Rs 2 billion. This suggests that even if the bank were to reverse its growth strategy, it might not significantly impact its profitability. However, a substantial credit loss on the advance book could indeed have a considerable impact on the bank\u2019s profitability.\n\nThe current situation\n\nThese statements paint a picture up until September 30, 2023. This possibly means that at this moment only the internal stakeholders were aware of the microfinance bank\u2019s issues.\n\nThe speculations about the microfinance bank\u2019s financial health began in October when the leadership of the bank suddenly changed. On October 18, it was announced that Kabeer Naqvi, CEO of UBank had resigned. The next day on October 19, according to a press release by the bank, Mohamed Essa Al Taheri was announced as the acting President and CEO of UBank.\n\nThis sudden change in leadership led to viral online conjectures about the financial stability of both UBank and UPaisa, with claims of their capital reserves teetering into the negative. Social media rumours exacerbated the situation, prompting depositors to withdraw their funds.\n\nConsequently, in a press release issued on October 23, the PTCL Group vehemently dismissed all allegations and speculations surrounding the financial well-being of its wholly-owned subsidiary, UBank. The leading ICT services provider in Pakistan reiterated that UBank possessed a resilient capital base and that PTCL group would support UBank in meeting any future growth requirements \u2013 which it did, as stated in the recent financial statements.\n\nFuture outlook\n\nThis means that any loss or major change that led to a leadership shuffle and capital injection would be reflected in the audited yearly financial statements. There is a possibility that UBank, which was once touted as one of the biggest microfinance banks, might not remain the biggest microfinance bank as its size of balance sheet continues to shrink, as evidenced by the equity of UBank that has declined from around Rs 7 billion to Rs 5 billion in these nine months.\n\nThere\u2019s a looming possibility that UBank\u2019s deposits, especially the ones from banks and financial institutions, could decrease significantly. At the same time, there is also a possibility that by year-end, PTCL Group will restore confidence in UBank, and any deposits that left the bank might return.\n\nFor now, the future of UBank remains shrouded in mystery. The position will become clearer as the institution releases its yearly report. Thus we will have to wait till next year, when the year-end 2023 audited accounts of UBank are published, to see what happened.",

            "text": "Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Limited (SCBPL), a subsidiary of Standard Chartered Plc, said on Tuesday that the announcement of financial results for the year 2023 \u201ctriggered\u201d a positive trend in the price of its shares.\n\nIn a notice to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), which was aimed at responding to a PSX letter, SCBPL stated: \u201cWe understand that a positive trend in the price of the shares of SCBPL was triggered with the announcement of financial results on 23 February 2024 as investors reacted favourably to the strong financial performance of the bank in the backdrop of overall bullish trend in the stock market.\u201d\n\nThe notice came as the company\u2019s share price remained largely stable from November 01, 2023, to March 27, 2024, hovering in the range of Rs34-39, as per data available at the PSX.\n\nHowever, it witnessed an upward swing and since the last week of March has surged nearly 66% to hit a high of Rs59.9 earlier this month.\n\nThe share price movement prompted the PSX to send a notice on April 22, requiring the bank to furnish information that would explain the development. In its notice, the PSX said it observed \u201cunusual share price movement between March 18, 2024 to April 15, 2024\u201d.\n\nMeanwhile, SCBPL in its filing to the bourse on Tuesday said it \u201cis not aware of any other development information that may be relevant to the unusual movement in the price of the shares of the bank\u201d.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, the Bank remains fully committed for meticulous compliance with all the regulatory provisions and will continue to ensure immediate dissemination of any price sensitive information to Pakistan Stock Exchange,\u201d it added.\n\nAs per SCBPL\u2019s latest financial results, released on February 23, 2024, the bank posted earnings of Rs42.62 billion in 2023, up nearly 115% from the profit-after-tax Rs19.84 billion recorded in the same period of the preceding year.\n\nThe bank\u2019s earnings per share stood at Rs11.01 in 2023, an increase from Rs5.13 in 2022.\n\nThe bank\u2019s Board of Directors also announced a final cash dividend at Rs2.5 per share i.e. 25%. This was in addition to the interim dividend already paid at Rs6.5 per share i.e. 65%.\n\nThe profit was attributed to a significant increase in net interest income and provisioning reversals.",

            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) staged a dramatic turnaround after plunging over 1,450 points in the opening few minutes of trading on Tuesday after it was learnt that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was not onboard with the government\u2019s circular debt plan.\n\nAfter falling below the 60,000 level during the opening hours of trading to hit an intra-day low of 59,613.17 \u2013 a fall of over 1,450 points - the KSE-100 began its recovery.\n\nAt close, the benchmark index settled at 61,226.93, an increase of 161.61 points or 0.26%.\n\nIndex-heavy energy stocks including OGDC, PPL, PSO and SNGP, however, were still in the red.\n\nThe earlier negativity came after the IMF said the interim government\u2019s tariff rationalisation and circular debt management plans do not address the underlying problems of Pakistan\u2019s energy sector.\n\n\u201cRestoring the viability of the energy sector is critical to Pakistan\u2019s economic recovery and fiscal sustainability,\u201d IMF Mission Chief Nathan Porter told Business Recorder via message on Monday.\n\n\u201cFor this, it is essential for the government to focus on broad-based reforms, including to reduce the high cost of energy, improve compliance and reduce theft and line losses, end captive power, and fix the governance and management of the DISCOs, as well as keep up with regular tariff adjustments.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the proposed plan does not address the underlying problems. In particular, the circular debt neutrality of the tariff rationalisation plan is doubtful and it would place a significant additional burden on vulnerable households.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarket was expecting a big dividend due to this,\u201d said Mohammed Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, in a note.\n\nExperts said the market\u2019s downward trajectory was led by OGDC and PPL in addition to political uncertainty that dampened sentiment as formation of a coalition government was seemingly still away from being finalised.\n\nAfter its recovery, an analyst said strong corporate showing is driving the index upwards.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is no positive development on the economic front, strong corporate results are acting as a support factor,\u201d Sana Tawfik, an analyst at AHL, told Business Recorder.\n\nOn the corporate front, Allied Bank Limited posted a profit growth of nearly 95% during 2023, as compared to the preceding year.\n\nMeanwhile, others were of the view that the recovery comes over market expectations of the formation of a coalition government soon.\n\n\u201cThe recovery comes amid hope that soon a coalition government will take charge, and things will be smooth,\u201d Sohail told Business Recorder later during trading.\n\nOn Monday, the wider market had shrugged off a post on Sunday evening by the Petroleum Division, Ministry of Energy with index-heavy OGDC and PPL deep in the red, dragging the KSE-100 with selling pressure also due to political uncertainty after the General Elections.\n\nAt close, the KSE-100 settled at 61,065.31, down 1,878.43 points or 2.98%. This was the lowest closing of the benchmark index since December 27, 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, the rupee registered a marginal increase of 0.01% against the US dollar in the inter-bank market. At close, the local unit settled at 279.31 after a gain of Re0.02 against the greenback, as per the State Bank of Pakistan.\n\nVolume on the all-share index increased to 435.5 million from 350 million a session ago.\n\nThe value of shares rose to Rs15.97 billion from Rs12.74 billion in the previous session.\n\nK-Electric Ltd was the volume leader with 65.8 million shares, followed by WorldCall Telecom with 30.1 million shares, and Pak Refinery with 28.6 million shares.\n\nShares of 355 companies were traded on Tuesday, of which 188 registered an increase, 139 recorded a fall, while 28 remained unchanged.",

Some amount of correction and valuation adjustment will happen,\u201d Gandhi said.\n\nIndian shares inch up, led by metals and auto stocks\n\nThe trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio for Kotak Mahindra Bank is at 20.99, higher than that for peers like HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank and IndusInd Bank, indicating a high valuation, according to LSEG data.\n\nThe Nifty 50 is unlikely to see a significant drop because of sustained domestic buying and fourth-quarter results mostly in line with expectations, Gandhi said.\n\nAxis Bank jumped 4% to be the top Nifty 50 gainer after the private lender beat quarterly profit estimates.\n\nThe consumer index fell 0.4%, with Tata Consumer Products and Hindustan Unilever falling between 1%-2% after they missed their March quarter earnings estimates.\n\nIT company LTIMindtree fell 1.6% after missing fourth-quarter revenue estimates on weakness in banking vertical and client spending.\n\nNon-bank lender Mas Financial Services climbed 7% after posting a rise in March-quarter profit.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Pakistan Stock Exchange witnessed bullish trend and hit historic highest levels with exceptionally increasing trading volumes during the outgoing week ended on November 17, 2023 on the back of aggressive buying after Staff Level Agreement with IMF, growing anticipation of interest rate cut and decline in oil prices in both local and international markets.\n\nThe benchmark KSE-100 index surged by 1671.79 points on week-on-week basis and crossed 57,000 historic-level to close at 57,063.16 points.\n\nTrading activities also improved as average daily volumes on ready counter increased by 39.8 percent to 760.76 million shares as compared to previous week\u2019s average of 544.05 million shares while average daily traded value on ready counter increased by 22.5 percent to Rs 23.71 billion during this week against previous week\u2019s Rs 19.36 billion.\n\nBRIndex100 added 176.35 points during this week to close at 5,824.81 points with average daily turnover of 682.491 million shares.\n\nBRIndex30 increased by 861.10 points on week-on-week basis to close at 20,644.17 points with average daily trading volumes of 482.941 million shares.\n\nThe foreign investors also remained net buyers of shares worth $8.218 million. Total market capitalization increased by Rs 328 billion to Rs 8.281 trillion.\n\nAn analyst at AKD Securities said that the market sustained its positive momentum and surged to record highs, with the KSE100 index closing at record high of 57,397points on Thursday before a slight correction to close at 57,063points on Friday, an impressive 3.02 percent WoW increase.\n\nThe week centred on the IMF review, concluding with a successful staff-level agreement, anticipating a $700million inflow post-IMF Board approval. A major development was the government\u2019s implementation of a 40 percent tax on banks\u2019 windfall income, meeting IMF demands and to agree on further revision in the gas prices in January 2024.\n\nThe market participation witnessed a substantial improvement, with an average traded volume of 687million shares, marking a 26 percent WoW increase from the previous week\u2019s average of 544million shares. Notably, Thursday saw participation cross the 1.0 billion share mark for the first time in last 28 months.\n\nSector-wise, close-end mutual funds, synthetic & rayon, and woollen were amongst the top performers, up 24.0 percent/21.7 percent/12.0 percent respectively. On the other hand, vanaspati & allied industries, commercial banks, and textile weaving were amongst the negative performers with a decline of 0.5 percent/0.5 percent/0.4 percent WoW.\n\nFlow wise, major net selling was recorded by Banks with a net sell of $9.14million. On the other hand, Foreigners remain bullish with a net buy of $8.22million.\n\nCompany-wise, top performers during the week were HGFA (up 26.0 percent), PAEL (up 22.7 percent), RMPL (up 21.3 percent), IBFL (up 20.8 percent) and PKGP (up 19.6 percent), while top laggards were BIPL (down 7.6 percent), BAFL (down 6.7 percent), CNERGY (down 5.4 percent), PABC (down 3.9 percent) and MEBL (down 3.6 percent).\n\nAn analyst at JS Global Capital said that the KSE-100 index continued to score new highs, closing at 57,063, up 3 percent WoW.\n\nOptimism in the market was mainly driven by decent inflows, Staff Level Agreement with the IMF, growing anticipation of interest rate cuts following the recent drop in T-bill cut-off yields, and decline in both domestic and international oil prices.\n\nPakistan is now expected to receive around $700million in December 2023 subject to approval by the IMF\u2019s Executive Board. Subsequent to IMF talks, the government also hinted further hike in gas prices in January 2024. Federal Cabinet also approved imposition of 40 percent additional tax on Banks\u2019 Income from FX retrospectively, for CY21-22, which impacted banking stocks\u2019 performance.\n\nInternational Oil prices on the other hand, continued to drop, hitting a 4-month low over concerns on the US and Chinese demand. This week, the MSCI quarterly review revealed that 17 Pakistani stocks maintained their inclusion in the MSCI Frontier Market Index, with no changes. However, there were adjustments in the MSCI FM Small Caps Index scheduled to take effect from December01, 2023. Notably, KOHC, MLCF, FABL, and SHEL were removed from the index, while PSMC, AGHA, SAZEW, and AGP were added.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2023",
