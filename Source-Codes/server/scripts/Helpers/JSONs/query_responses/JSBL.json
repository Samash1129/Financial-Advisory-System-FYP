PSO maintained a market share of 54.5pc in the diesel market.\n\nThe company also retained its leading position in the black oil market, selling 247,000 tonnes during the period, despite a 74.6pc decline in sales year-on-year due to reduced furnace oil-based power generation. PSO held 99.40pc market share in the Jet fuel industry.\n\nFCEPL\n\nFrieslandCampina Engro Pakistan Ltd (FCEPL) delivered a strong top-line growth of 21pc to Rs 27.5bn for three months ending March 2024 from Rs22.7bn in the same period last year despite the challenging operating environment and economic slowdown. This increase was fueled by volume growth and relevant consumer offerings.\n\nPAT as a percentage of sales plunged by 200bps over last year to Rs0.67bn from Rs0.99bn in the same period last year due to an increase in interest rates. A brea\u00adkup reveals that dairy-based products reported revenue of Rs26.1bn, up 15pc over the same period last year. Revenue from the frozen segment stood at Rs1.36bn as against Rs1.44bn in the above period.\n\nJS Bank profit surges 376pc\n\nJS Bank Ltd (JSBL) posted a record consolidated profit of Rs4.2bn in the first quarter of the calendar year 2024.\n\nIn a filing to the PSX, the bank reported that its PAT jumped by 376pc compared to the same period in 2023. The EPS rose to Rs1.66 compared to Rs0.68.\n\nPublished in Dawn, April 27th, 2024",

            "text": "KARACHI: Share prices fell sharply in the second half of Friday\u2019s trading session on the stock market amid selling pressure emanating from uncertainty on monetary policy stance and the government\u2019s plans to reduce circular debt and industrial power tariff, as a result the benchmark KSE 100 index settled below 64,000 level.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said stocks fell on pre-poll uncertainty and investor concerns for unresolved power sector circular debt, which rose to Rs2.55 trillion in the first half of FY24.\n\nHe said the uncertainty over IMF approval on the SIFC directive for the Rs1.27tr circular debt settlement plan and weak industrial earnings outlook amid surging gas tariff played a catalyst role in the bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the benchmark index opened on a positive note posting an intraday high of 236 points, but pressure was observed in the second half on account of profit-taking by investors in banks ahead of the monetary policy committee meeting due on Monday.\n\nOil and Gas Development Company Ltd, HabibMetro Bank, Indus Motor, Allied Bank Ltd and Lucky Core Industries cumulatively added 154 points to the index. On the flip side, Mari Petroleum, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank, Habib Bank and Bank Alhabib Ltd lost value to weigh down on the index by 226 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 63,813.06 points after shedding 484.94 points or 0.75 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume further dipped by 10.39pc to 412.82 million shares. The traded value also plunged by 35.89pc to Rs16.18bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan International Airline Corporation Ltd (66.17m shares), K-Electric (47.10m shares), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (31.07m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (20.13m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (18.82m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Atlas Honda Ltd (Rs28.52), Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs25.42), JS Global Capital Ltd (Rs11.64), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs11.45) and JDW Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs10.00).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs400.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs82.29), Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs44.89), Siemens Pakistan Ltd (Rs32.01) and Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs25.00).\n\nForeign investors indulged in aggressive selling as they disposed of shares worth $10.05m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 27th, 2024",

            "short_description": "'Tale of two halves', but a year to remember for Pakistan stocks  Business Recorder",
            "text": "2023 emerged as the year of turnaround for the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) as the KSE-100 hit new peaks and emerged as the best-performing asset class in the country, delivering a return of nearly 55% in the 12-month period (in rupee terms).\n\nThe KSE-100 Index signed off 2023 at 62,451.04, an increase of 22,031 points or nearly 55% in calendar year 2023.\n\nHowever, the PSX story was a tale of two halves and can be simply divided into two phases i.e. before and after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.\n\nSource: AHL\n\nThe South Asian nation commenced 2023 engulfed in a myriad of challenges, including rising risk of debt default, unprecedented inflation figures, record-high yields on government bills, and political instability.\n\nAll these factors created a challenging market environment, especially for investors, who preferred remaining on the sidelines during the first few months of the year, while keeping a close watch on resumption of the IMF programme.\n\nThis is evident from the fact that the KSE-100 Index remained largely stagnant climbing from the 40,420 level on December 30, 2022, to 41,452.69 on June 27, 2023, reflecting a marginal increase of just 2.5%.\n\nHowever, tides shifted on June 30, during the Eid ul Azha holidays, after Pakistan managed to clinch a last-minute agreement with the IMF, as the two parties reached an agreement on policies to be supported by a $3-billion, nine-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).\n\nThe new IMF arrangement, seen as a massive positive for the government and the economy reeling from crisis, not only extended Pakistan\u2019s commitment with the lender well into the second half of fiscal year 2023-24, but also was an upgrade from the earlier expectation that the country would receive $1.1 billion after the ninth review.\n\n\u201cThe IMF SBA was a breakthrough, which dictated the trajectory of the stock market,\u201d Mahroz Khan, analyst at Optimus Digital, told Business Recorder.\n\nSimilar sentiments were provided by other market analysts as the resumption of the IMF programme ensured policy stability.\n\n\u201cFrom 2017 onwards, the performance of PSX was quite rangebound, as stock valuations remain fairly low despite strong corporate performance,\u201d said Mustafa Pasha, Chief Investment Officer at Lakson Investments.\n\n\u201cThe IMF programme emerged as a trigger point, as the risk of default was averted which pumped confidence among the investors,\u201d he said.\n\nThe impact was evident as the benchmark KSE-100 Index jumped from 41,452.69 on June 27, 2023 to 62,451.04 on December 29, 2023, the last trading session of the calendar year, registering a massive growth of nearly 51%.\n\nFollowing the IMF programme, another major positive for the stock market was the smooth transition of power to the interim government setup as a caretaker cabinet under interim Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, tasked with running the country until fresh elections, took charge in August.\n\n\u201cThis diminished much uncertainty on the political front,\u201d said an analyst.\n\nWhat followed was a series of measures taken by the interim government including State Bank of Pakistan \u201cstructural reforms\u201d for the Exchange Companies and the administrative steps against smugglers and hoarding of currency and illegal exchanges, which stabilized the rupee while adding to investor confidence.\n\n\u201cMeasures in the energy sector, especially the gas price hike, was a key, as this alleviated the issue of circular debt in the index-heavy energy sector,\u201d said Mahroz Khan.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the performance of E&P sector improved, which also trickled down to the banking sector driving the stock market upwards\u201d, he said.\n\nMoreover, continuous talks with the Washington-based lender and improvement in rupee value kept the investors upbeat, as the PSX crossed the coveted 50,000 mark on October 19, a milestone achieved after over six years.\n\nThe momentum persisted in the following weeks and the stock market continued to ink new records with every passing trading session. The increased participation of foreign investors in particular was a sign that businesses were expecting an up cycle amid hopes of recovery in the country\u2019s economy.\n\nIn November, Pakistan\u2019s stock market saw the highest monthly net inflow of foreign portfolio investment in four years, as international corporates purchased shares worth $66 million and sold $31 million in November, resulting in a net buying of $35 million, the highest monthly inflow since 2017.\n\nDuring the same month i.e. November 15, the IMF staff and Pakistani authorities reached an agreement on the first review of the $3-billion, nine-month SBA., which as expected further bolstered the equities, that were already enjoying a buying spree on account of attractive valuations and improved macroeconomic indicators.\n\nThus, the PSX continued its upward march well into the final weeks of the year hitting the highest-ever level of 66,426 on December 12. Meanwhile, despite some hiccups, which many analysts termed as much-needed correction, the stock market signed off the year on a bullish note.\n\n\u201cSectors contributing positively to index include banks (7,162 points), fertilizer (2,661 points), E&P (2,553 points), Power (2,470 points) and cement (2,148 points),\u201d said Arif Habib Limited, a brokerage house in its latest report.\n\n\u201cHowever, the laggards comprised of technology (-452 points) followed by miscellaneous (-170 points), textile spinning (-10 points), and vanaspati (-9 points).\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, scrip wise top contributions to the upside were HUBC (2,077 points, 84% of total power sector contribution), UBL (1,611 points, 22% of total banking sector contribution), HBL (1,035 points, 14% of total banking sector) and MCB (1,031 points, 14% of total banking sector).\n\n\u201cScrip wise negative contributors were i) TRG (-317 points), ii) PSEL (-308 points), and iii) SYS (-237 points).\u201d\n\nA dismal year for IPOs\n\nDespite achieving new highs, the year 2023 was not good for Initial Public Offerings IPO as the Pakistani equities market saw just one IPO i.e. Symmetry Group that managed to raise a meager Rs435 million funds. This was the lowest amount raised in a year in the past decade and half of the previous record low of Rs800 million seen in 2013, shared Topline Securities.\n\n\u201cWe attribute this bad IPO trend to macro-economic instability, coupled with the looming threat of default, cheap valuations and political uncertainty discouraging equity investment,\u201d the brokerage house said in a report.\n\nMeanwhile, Murtaza Jafer, Director of Equity Sales at Optimus Capital, blamed the trend on low valuations in the market, which didn\u2019t help attract much interest.\n\n\u201cHowever, I believe we would see a lot of listings post-general elections,\u201d he said.\n\nPSX Outlook\n\nMarket experts believe that despite the record showing in 2023, PSX has more to achieve in the coming months, as market valuations remain attractive.\n\n\u201c2023 was a year of recovery, however, I believe it is just a start,\u201d said Pasha.\n\n\u201cThe KSE-100 index may climb to 85-90k level by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cHowever, for that timely elections must be held, while a new IMF agreement should also be inked by the elected government. These will be the key macro triggers that will dictate the future market trajectory,\u201d he added.\n\nOther experts also echoed similar views.\n\n\u201cTimely elections are important, both for the general as well as the business community,\u201d said Mahroz Khan.\n\nKhan was of the view that under the new IMF agreement, expected to be reached next year, the lender is likely to stress increasing the country\u2019s tax base, which remains very low.\n\n\u201cEven after the recent rally of 50%+ we believe there is much room for upside,\u201d Amreen Soorani, Head of Research at JS Global, told Business Recorder, as she added that the KSE-100 Index is still trading on attractive multiples.\n\nThe market\u2019s current price-to-earnings P/E (blue chips) is still close to 3x and still reflects a discount of ~40% to the Index\u2019s recent mean of multiples, she said.\n\n\u201c(However) For the continuity of the rally, it would be very important for the ongoing developments on the macro front to continue and for the government to ensure the country\u2019s gross financing needs are met, keeping PKR depreciation as gradual as possible,\u201d Amreen added.",

PHOTO: AFP\n\nPakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday showed signs of recovery as investors took cue from the decline in inflation reading to 20.68% for March 2024, which could lead to an easing of monetary policy by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).\n\nEarlier, trading began on a positive note but soon the KSE-100 index dropped and hit its intra-day low of 66,573.63 points, reflecting the loss suffered in the previous session. However, the market started rising gradually, driven by the robust performance of global stocks and increase in international crude oil prices.\n\nAdditionally, government discussions on the privatisation of struggling state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and rupee stability following a staff-level agreement (SLA) between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also contributed to the bullish momentum.\n\nConsequently, the index reached the intra-day high at 66,959.54 points, falling just short of the 67,000 mark. With some profit-taking at the peak where investors seemed cautious ahead of Eid holidays, the market closed with thin gains.\n\n\u201cStocks showed recovery as investors weighed 20.68% CPI (Consumer Price Index) inflation for March 2024, which is likely to lead to the easing of SBP policy next month,\u201d said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.\n\n\u201cSurging global stocks and crude oil prices, government deliberations on privatisation of ailing SOEs and rupee stability after Pakistan-IMF SLA in the final review played the role of catalysts in bullish close at the PSX.\u201d\n\nAt close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 89.94 points, or 0.13%, and settled at 66,886.26.\n\nTopline Securities, in its report, said Pakistan equities kicked off the day on a positive note as the KSE-100 index reached its intra-day high just below 67,000 at 66,960 (+163 points). However, at the day\u2019s high, profit-taking initiated.\n\n\u201cThis market behaviour can be attributed to investors\u2019 stance to remain sidelined ahead of Eid holidays scheduled for next week and in the absence of any triggers, which may influence market direction,\u201d it said.\n\nThe day\u2019s positive contributors were Dawood Hercules Corporation, Systems Limited, Fauji Fertiliser, MCB Bank and Bank Alfalah, which added 202 points.\n\nNegative contributors were Hub Power, Pakistan Petroleum, Engro Fertilisers, Pakistan Tobacco and Mari Petroleum, which lost 110 points, it added.\n\nArif Habib Limited (AHL), in its review, said that it was a \u201cflat day with the market rallying from the low of 66,600 to just below 67,000\u201d.\n\nSome 41 stocks rose while 48 fell with Dawood Hercules (+5.42%), Systems Limited (+2.85%) and Fauji Fertiliser (+0.94%) being the largest contributors to the index gains, it said, adding that according to the World Bank the economic growth in Pakistan was expected to pick up from the current fiscal year but would remain below 3% for the next two years.\n\nJS Global analyst Muhammad Shuja Qureshi said that a volatile session ended with gains of 90 points in the KSE-100 index at 66,886. \u201cGoing forward, investors are advised to accumulate value stocks on dips,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nOverall trading volumes increased to 239.6 million shares against Monday\u2019s tally of 238.8 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs8.9 billion.\n\nShares of 342 companies were traded. Of these, 160 stocks closed higher, 153 dropped and 29 remained unchanged.\n\nWorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 32.3 million shares, gaining Rs0.05 to close at Rs1.35. It was followed by PTCL with 27.1 million shares, losing Rs0.48 to close at Rs16.46 and Pakistan Reinsurance Company with 13.1 million shares, losing Rs0.48 to close at Rs15.46.\n\nForeign investors were net buyers of shares worth Rs117.4 million, according to the NCCPL.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, April 3rd, 2024.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",

            "short_description": "PSX bounces back on SBP, IMF optimism  The Express Tribune",
            "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday experienced a modest recovery, fueled by anticipation surrounding the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) monetary policy announcement and optimism about the International Monetary Fund\u2019s (IMF) final review under its standby arrangement (SBA).\n\nIn the morning, trading began on a positive note but the KSE-100 index soon plunged to the intra-day low at 64,811.92 points. Thereafter, it recovered rapidly and after frequent ups and down, the index reached the intra-day high at 65,148.36 points.\n\nAt that point, investors got an opportunity to opt for profit-taking over caution ahead of the monetary policy announcement scheduled for around 4pm. Resultantly, the bourse fell close to its intra-day low post-midday trading, slipping below the 65,000 mark.\n\nNevertheless, the market rebounded, propelled by surging global crude oil prices and strengthening of the Pakistani rupee, driven by optimism surrounding the IMF\u2019s review for the release of $1.2 billion loan tranche. Fertiliser, banking and power sectors mainly contributed positively to the index.\n\nDespite closing below 65,000, the market managed to recover all the earlier losses, ending the day positively. \u201cStocks showed recovery on speculation ahead of SBP\u2019s announcement later today (Monday) and hopes for a productive final IMF review for the release of SBA tranche,\u201d said Ahsan Mehanti, MD of Arif Habib Corp.\n\nRead: PSX under pressure over IMF talk concerns\n\n\u201cSurging global crude oil prices and stronger rupee played the role of catalysts in positive close at the PSX.\u201d\n\nAt close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded an increase of 74.04 points, or 0.11%, and settled at 64,890.51. Topline Securities Deputy Head of Sales Ali Najib, in his report, said \u201cPakistan equities kicked off the week on a positive note as the KSE-100 index touched intra-day high at 65,148 (+332 points; or 0.51%) in the morning. However, at the day\u2019s high, profit-taking kicked in.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis market behaviour can be attributed to a cautious approach adopted by investors ahead of monetary policy announcement (scheduled at around 4pm),\u201d he said. A majority at the street expected the central bank to maintain the status quo. However, a surprise reduction in rate would be taken positively by the PSX, Najib added.\n\nFertiliser, banking and power sectors contributed positively to the index as Fauji Fertiliser, Meezan Bank, Hub Power, United Bank and Dawood Hercules cumulatively added 141 points.\n\nOn the flip side, Lucky Cement, Systems Limited and MCB Bank saw some profit-taking as they lost 72 points, Topline added.\n\nArif Habib Limited (AHL), in its report, commented that there was \u201ca dull start to the week ahead of the SBP rate decision where views were mixed regarding the start of an easing cycle now or later in the year.\u201d\n\nTop index contributors were Fauji Fertiliser (+2.03%), Meezan Bank (+1.8%) and Hub Power (+0.98%), it said, adding that Pakistan Telecommunication Company (+7.58%) was the standout performer, which kept the tech sector in the limelight and had gained 29.47% month to date. JS Global analyst Mubashir Anis Naviwala said that the PSX saw range-bound activity with the KSE-100 index closing at 64,890 with gains of 74 points.\n\n\u201cGoing forward, we recommend investors to consider any downside as an opportunity to buy stocks in banking, and exploration and production (E&P) sectors,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nOverall trading volumes decreased to 211.8 million shares against Friday\u2019s tally of 259.4 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs7.8 billion.\n\nShares of 328 companies were traded. Of these, 145 stocks closed higher, 158 dropped and 25 remained unchanged.\n\nWorldCall Telecom was the volume leader with trading in 16.6 million shares, gaining Rs0.02 to close at Rs1.36.
