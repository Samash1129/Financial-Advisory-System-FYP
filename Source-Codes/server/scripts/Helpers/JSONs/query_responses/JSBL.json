            "text": "KARACHI: Share prices fell sharply in the second half of Friday\u2019s trading session on the stock market amid selling pressure emanating from uncertainty on monetary policy stance and the government\u2019s plans to reduce circular debt and industrial power tariff, as a result the benchmark KSE 100 index settled below 64,000 level.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said stocks fell on pre-poll uncertainty and investor concerns for unresolved power sector circular debt, which rose to Rs2.55 trillion in the first half of FY24.\n\nHe said the uncertainty over IMF approval on the SIFC directive for the Rs1.27tr circular debt settlement plan and weak industrial earnings outlook amid surging gas tariff played a catalyst role in the bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the benchmark index opened on a positive note posting an intraday high of 236 points, but pressure was observed in the second half on account of profit-taking by investors in banks ahead of the monetary policy committee meeting due on Monday.\n\nOil and Gas Development Company Ltd, HabibMetro Bank, Indus Motor, Allied Bank Ltd and Lucky Core Industries cumulatively added 154 points to the index. On the flip side, Mari Petroleum, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank, Habib Bank and Bank Alhabib Ltd lost value to weigh down on the index by 226 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 63,813.06 points after shedding 484.94 points or 0.75 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume further dipped by 10.39pc to 412.82 million shares. The traded value also plunged by 35.89pc to Rs16.18bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan International Airline Corporation Ltd (66.17m shares), K-Electric (47.10m shares), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (31.07m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (20.13m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (18.82m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Atlas Honda Ltd (Rs28.52), Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs25.42), JS Global Capital Ltd (Rs11.64), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs11.45) and JDW Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs10.00).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs400.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs82.29), Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs44.89), Siemens Pakistan Ltd (Rs32.01) and Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs25.00).\n\nForeign investors indulged in aggressive selling as they disposed of shares worth $10.05m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 27th, 2024",

            "text": "In Pakistan\u2019s Rawalpindi, food street comes alive for pre-dawn Ramadan meals\n\nISLAMABAD: In the Pakistani garrison city of Rawalpindi, restaurant and food stall owners are seen making special arrangements around midnight before crowds of people throng the famous Kartarpura food street to fulfill themselves with traditional Pakistani delicacies to get going through a day of fasting during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Kartarpura Street was part of Rawalpindi\u2019s Sikh neighborhood and the city\u2019s main commercial area, but over the past few decades it has developed into a food street and become famous for treats such as tender beef or mutton meat with bone marrow, known as nihari, and siri paye, a traditional breakfast dish of cow or goat head and trotters cooked overnight.\n\nDeserts like kheer, kulfi, lassi and refreshing pomegranate and plum drinks attract crowds of food enthusiasts from midnight till dawn during the whole month.\n\n\u201cThis is my first experience here. I had heard a lot about Kartarpura, heard from a lot of people that sehri [pre-dawn Ramadan meal] there is quite special and the breakfast is unique,\u201d said Usman Ahmed, a visitor.\n\n\u201cSo, this is my first time here and my experience has been excellent because there is a lot of variety here, you get different food on different shops with different tastes.\u201d\n\nMany of the food stall owners and vendors in the busy street are not residents of the city, but they come every year from far-flung areas to set up their stalls due to the increased footfall in Ramadan.\n\nSome of these stalls are even set up by established food businesses elsewhere in the country.\n\n\u201cMost people come here because [this] food street is famous and people from Gujranwala, Lahore and other far-flung areas come here to set up food stalls in Ramadan,\u201d said Muhammad Hamza Bhatti, a food vendor.\n\n\u201cPeople know that all sorts of food is available here, that\u2019s why you see the crowds here.\u201d\n\nFew customers, however, complain of the increase in prices which has dampened their spirits this Ramadan.\n\nPakistan, a nation of over 241 million people, is currently reeling from the impact of inflation that hit a historic high of 38 percent in May last year, but eased to 23.1 percent in February this year, still on the higher side mainly due to the high costs of energy and food.\n\n\u201cThis year, there is no rush [here]. These are the people who are on TikTok, making videos and nothing else. Otherwise, there is no rush only due to inflation,\u201d said Muhammad Adnan, another customer.\n\n\u201cInflation has increased to a level you cannot imagine. A bowl that used to cost Rs400 ($1.43) is selling for Rs1,600 ($5.74) to Rs1,800 ($6.45). A single person\u2019s bill is no less than Rs2,000 ($7.17).\u201d\n\nwith inputs from AFP",

            "short_description": "'Tale of two halves', but a year to remember for Pakistan stocks  Business Recorder",
            "text": "2023 emerged as the year of turnaround for the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) as the KSE-100 hit new peaks and emerged as the best-performing asset class in the country, delivering a return of nearly 55% in the 12-month period (in rupee terms).\n\nThe KSE-100 Index signed off 2023 at 62,451.04, an increase of 22,031 points or nearly 55% in calendar year 2023.\n\nHowever, the PSX story was a tale of two halves and can be simply divided into two phases i.e. before and after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.\n\nSource: AHL\n\nThe South Asian nation commenced 2023 engulfed in a myriad of challenges, including rising risk of debt default, unprecedented inflation figures, record-high yields on government bills, and political instability.\n\nAll these factors created a challenging market environment, especially for investors, who preferred remaining on the sidelines during the first few months of the year, while keeping a close watch on resumption of the IMF programme.\n\nThis is evident from the fact that the KSE-100 Index remained largely stagnant climbing from the 40,420 level on December 30, 2022, to 41,452.69 on June 27, 2023, reflecting a marginal increase of just 2.5%.\n\nHowever, tides shifted on June 30, during the Eid ul Azha holidays, after Pakistan managed to clinch a last-minute agreement with the IMF, as the two parties reached an agreement on policies to be supported by a $3-billion, nine-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).\n\nThe new IMF arrangement, seen as a massive positive for the government and the economy reeling from crisis, not only extended Pakistan\u2019s commitment with the lender well into the second half of fiscal year 2023-24, but also was an upgrade from the earlier expectation that the country would receive $1.1 billion after the ninth review.\n\n\u201cThe IMF SBA was a breakthrough, which dictated the trajectory of the stock market,\u201d Mahroz Khan, analyst at Optimus Digital, told Business Recorder.\n\nSimilar sentiments were provided by other market analysts as the resumption of the IMF programme ensured policy stability.\n\n\u201cFrom 2017 onwards, the performance of PSX was quite rangebound, as stock valuations remain fairly low despite strong corporate performance,\u201d said Mustafa Pasha, Chief Investment Officer at Lakson Investments.\n\n\u201cThe IMF programme emerged as a trigger point, as the risk of default was averted which pumped confidence among the investors,\u201d he said.\n\nThe impact was evident as the benchmark KSE-100 Index jumped from 41,452.69 on June 27, 2023 to 62,451.04 on December 29, 2023, the last trading session of the calendar year, registering a massive growth of nearly 51%.\n\nFollowing the IMF programme, another major positive for the stock market was the smooth transition of power to the interim government setup as a caretaker cabinet under interim Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, tasked with running the country until fresh elections, took charge in August.\n\n\u201cThis diminished much uncertainty on the political front,\u201d said an analyst.\n\nWhat followed was a series of measures taken by the interim government including State Bank of Pakistan \u201cstructural reforms\u201d for the Exchange Companies and the administrative steps against smugglers and hoarding of currency and illegal exchanges, which stabilized the rupee while adding to investor confidence.\n\n\u201cMeasures in the energy sector, especially the gas price hike, was a key, as this alleviated the issue of circular debt in the index-heavy energy sector,\u201d said Mahroz Khan.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the performance of E&P sector improved, which also trickled down to the banking sector driving the stock market upwards\u201d, he said.\n\nMoreover, continuous talks with the Washington-based lender and improvement in rupee value kept the investors upbeat, as the PSX crossed the coveted 50,000 mark on October 19, a milestone achieved after over six years.\n\nThe momentum persisted in the following weeks and the stock market continued to ink new records with every passing trading session. The increased participation of foreign investors in particular was a sign that businesses were expecting an up cycle amid hopes of recovery in the country\u2019s economy.\n\nIn November, Pakistan\u2019s stock market saw the highest monthly net inflow of foreign portfolio investment in four years, as international corporates purchased shares worth $66 million and sold $31 million in November, resulting in a net buying of $35 million, the highest monthly inflow since 2017.\n\nDuring the same month i.e. November 15, the IMF staff and Pakistani authorities reached an agreement on the first review of the $3-billion, nine-month SBA., which as expected further bolstered the equities, that were already enjoying a buying spree on account of attractive valuations and improved macroeconomic indicators.\n\nThus, the PSX continued its upward march well into the final weeks of the year hitting the highest-ever level of 66,426 on December 12. Meanwhile, despite some hiccups, which many analysts termed as much-needed correction, the stock market signed off the year on a bullish note.\n\n\u201cSectors contributing positively to index include banks (7,162 points), fertilizer (2,661 points), E&P (2,553 points), Power (2,470 points) and cement (2,148 points),\u201d said Arif Habib Limited, a brokerage house in its latest report.\n\n\u201cHowever, the laggards comprised of technology (-452 points) followed by miscellaneous (-170 points), textile spinning (-10 points), and vanaspati (-9 points).\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, scrip wise top contributions to the upside were HUBC (2,077 points, 84% of total power sector contribution), UBL (1,611 points, 22% of total banking sector contribution), HBL (1,035 points, 14% of total banking sector) and MCB (1,031 points, 14% of total banking sector).\n\n\u201cScrip wise negative contributors were i) TRG (-317 points), ii) PSEL (-308 points), and iii) SYS (-237 points).\u201d\n\nA dismal year for IPOs\n\nDespite achieving new highs, the year 2023 was not good for Initial Public Offerings IPO as the Pakistani equities market saw just one IPO i.e. Symmetry Group that managed to raise a meager Rs435 million funds. This was the lowest amount raised in a year in the past decade and half of the previous record low of Rs800 million seen in 2013, shared Topline Securities.\n\n\u201cWe attribute this bad IPO trend to macro-economic instability, coupled with the looming threat of default, cheap valuations and political uncertainty discouraging equity investment,\u201d the brokerage house said in a report.\n\nMeanwhile, Murtaza Jafer, Director of Equity Sales at Optimus Capital, blamed the trend on low valuations in the market, which didn\u2019t help attract much interest.\n\n\u201cHowever, I believe we would see a lot of listings post-general elections,\u201d he said.\n\nPSX Outlook\n\nMarket experts believe that despite the record showing in 2023, PSX has more to achieve in the coming months, as market valuations remain attractive.\n\n\u201c2023 was a year of recovery, however, I believe it is just a start,\u201d said Pasha.\n\n\u201cThe KSE-100 index may climb to 85-90k level by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cHowever, for that timely elections must be held, while a new IMF agreement should also be inked by the elected government. These will be the key macro triggers that will dictate the future market trajectory,\u201d he added.\n\nOther experts also echoed similar views.\n\n\u201cTimely elections are important, both for the general as well as the business community,\u201d said Mahroz Khan.\n\nKhan was of the view that under the new IMF agreement, expected to be reached next year, the lender is likely to stress increasing the country\u2019s tax base, which remains very low.\n\n\u201cEven after the recent rally of 50%+ we believe there is much room for upside,\u201d Amreen Soorani, Head of Research at JS Global, told Business Recorder, as she added that the KSE-100 Index is still trading on attractive multiples.\n\nThe market\u2019s current price-to-earnings P/E (blue chips) is still close to 3x and still reflects a discount of ~40% to the Index\u2019s recent mean of multiples, she said.\n\n\u201c(However) For the continuity of the rally, it would be very important for the ongoing developments on the macro front to continue and for the government to ensure the country\u2019s gross financing needs are met, keeping PKR depreciation as gradual as possible,\u201d Amreen added.",
