            "text": "Faysal Bank Limited (PSX: FABL) announced on Thursday to set up a fully-owned exchange company with an initial capital injection of Rs 1 billion.\n\nThis move aligns with the provisions outlined in Sections 96 and 131 of the Securities Act, 2015, and Regulation 5.6.1 of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) Rule Book.\n\nDuring a board meeting held on September 27, 2023, Faysal Bank Limited\u2019s board of directors approved the establishment of an exchange company, starting with an initial paid-up capital of Rs 1 billion, pending clearance and approval from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), bank\u2019s filing in the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) said.\n\nThis development follows recent efforts to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP has pledged to institute structural reforms in the exchange company sector, emphasizing the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe primary aim of this crackdown is to enhance oversight of the open market and strengthen governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures within the sector. The minimum capital requirement for exchange companies has been raised from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional requirement that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that Faysal Bank Limited joins the ranks of major banks keen on participating in this transformative shift. United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), and Allied Bank Limited (ABL) have all recently indicated their intentions to establish their own forex companies.\n\nHabib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had already ventured into exchange companies before the introduction of these new regulatory measures by the SBP.",

            "text": "Faysal Bank Limited (PSX: FABL) announced earnings (PAT) today for 3QCY23 at Rs. 4.65 billion (EPS: Rs. 3.06), depicting an increase of 34 percent year-on-year (YoY) or 7 percent QoQ (3QCY22 EPS: Rs. 2.28).\n\nThis jump in overall earnings was mainly on the back of growth in net profit earned, according to Arif Habib Limited. On a sequential basis, higher provisioning impacted the overall profitability.\n\nAlong with the result, FABL announced a DPS of Rs. 1 in 3QCY23, taking the 9MCY23 dividend to Rs. 2 per share.\n\nALSO READ UBL Posts Highest Ever Profit of Rs. 42 Billion in First 9 Months of 2023\n\nNet profit earned by the bank settled at Rs. 18.4 billion during 3QCY23, increasing 72 percent YoY and 4 percent QoQ. With this, the total net profit earned for 9MCY23 went up to Rs. 49 billion, marking an 83 percent YoY jump. Profit earned saw a jump of 89 percent during 9MCY23 while profit expensed was up by 93 percent.\n\nDuring 3QCY23, NFI reported a 2 percent YoY and a 3 percent QoQ growth, bringing the total NFI for 9MCY23 to Rs. 7.5 billion, a 6 percent YoY increase. This growth in 3QCY23 was mainly attributed to a substantial 50 percent YoY surge in fee income. However, there were declines in other areas, with FX income decreasing by 53 percent and losses on securities rising by 77 percent YoY to Rs. 553 million during 3QCY23.\n\nOn a sequential basis, fee income increased by 11 percent, while dividend and FX income declined by 86 percent and 23 percent, respectively.\n\nThe bank\u2019s provisioning in 3QCY23 amounted to Rs. 1.6 billion, in contrast to provisioning reversals of Rs. 330 million reported in the SPLY. However, when comparing it on a QoQ basis, there was a significant 68 percent increase in the provisioning charge. This brings the total provisioning for 9MCY23 to Rs. 3.9 billion, significantly higher than the provisioning reversal of Rs. 736 million during the same period last year.\n\nThe bank\u2019s OPEX increased 44 percent YoY in 3QCY23 clocking in at Rs. 10 billion (3QCY22: Rs. 6.97 billion). With this, Cost/Income stood at 48.3 percent in 3QCY23 against 53 percent same period last year. The effective tax rate was set at 50 percent during 3QCY23 compared to 51 percent last quarter.\n\nFABL\u2019s scrip at the bourse closed at Rs. 24.39, down by 3.56 percent or Rs. 0.9 with a turnover of 5,884,340 shares on Thursday.",

            "text": "The country\u2019s commercial banks are continuing to create their own exchange companies months after a massive crackdown on Pakistan\u2019s currency market.\n\nThe latest in the list is Faysal Bank, which has inched closer towards launching its own exchange company. On January 17, 2024, Faysal Bank notified the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) that it had received a \u2018Certificate of Incorporation\u2019 for its exchange company subsidiary.\n\nThis was the culmination of a process that began on September 28, 2023, when the bank announced its intention to set up a fully-owned exchange company with an initial capital of Rs 1 billion. The bank\u2019s board of directors had given their approval for the project on September 27, 2023, subject to the clearance and approval of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), as per the bank\u2019s filing on the PSX.\n\nThe bank crossed the first milestone when it obtained a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the SBP on November 1, 2023, for establishing an exchange company named \u2018Faysal Islami Currency Exchange Company (Private) Limited\u2019.\n\nPreviously, Meezan Bank received a certificate of incorporation from SECP for its exchange subsidiary, Meezan Exchange Company (Pvt.) Limited on November 14, 2023. Meezan Bank informed via PSX notification that it would submit an application to SBP for the issuance of a license to commence operations, as per the SBP Exchange Companies Manual.\n\nWhy are banks setting up exchange companies?\n\nIn early September, the SBP made a decisive move, signalling that it had had enough. It unfurled a sweeping set of reforms targeting exchange companies.\n\nUnder the new reforms, banks were asked to set up exchange companies. \u201cLeading banks actively engaged in foreign exchange business will establish wholly owned Exchange Companies to cater to the legitimate foreign exchange needs of the general public,\u201d read the press release.\n\nA source disclosed to Profit that the SBP with the full force of the state had been involved in a crackdown on exchange companies. As such the top 10 banks were asked to open exchange companies. While the National Bank of Pakistan and Habib Bank already had exchange companies, Meezan Bank, Allied Bank, Habib Metropolitan Bank, Bank Alfalah, Faysal Bank, Askari Bank and Bank Al Habib were also ordered to set them up. The orders \u201ccame from the very top\u201d, the source said.\n\nRead: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve?\n\nUnited Bank wasted no time in announcing its venture into the exchange company arena on September 12, six days after the reforms were rolled out. UBL\u2019s move triggered a domino effect, with a lineup of other banks swiftly joining the fray. Meezan Bank joined the list three days later. In the following weeks, more banks followed suit which included MCB Bank, Bank A lHabib, Allied Bank, and Faysal Bank.\n\nReforms in the exchange companies sector\n\nThe primary objective of these reforms was tightening control over the open market and fortifying governance, internal controls, and compliance standards within the sector. The reforms came a little over a year after the SBP suspended the operations of several branches and franchises of exchange companies over regulatory violations. The central bank had launched a crackdown against exchange companies on apprehensions that they were not selling foreign currency to customers despite availability, leading to exchange rate volatility and a wide difference in rates offered in the interbank market and those quoted by the companies and commercial banks.\n\nPreviously, exchange companies in category A had a higher minimum capital requirement \u2014 Rs 20 crore \u2014 while those in category B had a lower minimum capital requirement of Rs 2.5 crore. The latter could only act as money changers.\n\nUnder the reforms, all exchange companies in categories A and B along with franchises of exchange companies were to be consolidated and transformed into a single category with a well-defined mandate.\n\nThe minimum capital requirement for exchange companies for category A was bumped up from Rs 20 crore to Rs 50 crore, free of losses.\n\nCategory B exchange companies were given three options: merge with an existing exchange company, upgrade to full exchange company status, or consolidate with other category B exchange companies to form a unified entity. They had to approach the SBP within one month for a NOC for one of these choices. After receiving the NOC, they had three months to meet regulatory and legal requirements for formal licensing, failing which, their licences would be cancelled.\n\nSimilarly, franchises of exchange companies were given two options: either merge with the franchiser exchange company or sell the franchise to it. They had one month to seek the approval of the central bank for the merger or sale. The failure to do so would result in cancellation of licenses.",

            "text": "Faysal Bank Limited (PSX: FABL) continued its strong profitability trend, with its net profit reaching Rs. 20.2 billion in 2023, marking a 77% increase compared to the previous year.\n\nAccording to the financial results, Pakistan\u2019s second-biggest Islamic bank recorded a profit of over Rs. 20 billion in 2023 which stood at Rs. 11.4 billion in 2022, showing a whopping increase of Rs. 8.81 billion. According to Arif Habib Limited, this is FABL\u2019s highest-ever profit after tax, fueled by a surge in profit earned spurred by a 600 bps hike in interest rates during the year.\n\nThis jump in overall earnings was mainly on the back of growth in total income.\n\nFABL posted its highest ever profit after tax of PKR 20.2bn, marking a YoY jump of 77%. This unprecedented profitability was mainly fueled by surge in profit earned spurred by a 600bps hike in interest rates during the year.@Pakstockexgltd @StateBank_Pak @Faysalbankltd#KSE100\u2026 pic.twitter.com/5GOz4YFn42 \u2014 Arif Habib Limited (@ArifHabibLtd) February 7, 2024\n\nALSO READ MCB Bank Posts Its Highest Ever Annual Profit in 2023\n\nNet Profit Earned by the bank clocked in at Rs. 21.9 billion during 4QCY23, increasing 68 percent YoY and 19 percent QoQ.

This jump in NFI during CY23 was primarily due to higher fee and commission income which posted a jump of 30 percent YoY, clocking in at Rs. 9.4 billion. Moreover, FX income too was significantly up 67 percent in CY23, reaching Rs. 4.8 billion. However, FABL posted a loss on securities of Rs. 1.8 billion as compared to a loss of Rs. 1.5 billion recorded in SPLY.\n\nFABL booked provisioning reversals of Rs. 2.8 billion during 4QCY23 (4QCY22 reversals: Rs. 204 million) depicting a significant jump of 13x on a YoY basis. This takes the total provisioning to Rs. 1.2 billion during CY23 (CY22 reversals: Rs. 940 million).\n\nThe bank\u2019s OPEX increased 55 percent YoY in 4QCY23 clocking in at Rs. 13 billion (4QCY22: Rs. 8.3 billion).

            "short_description": "Faysal Bank Limited - BR Research  Business Recorder",
            "text": "Faysal Bank Limited (PSX: FABL) was incorporated in Pakistan as a public limited company in 1994. The bank surrendered its conventional banking license on December 31, 2022 and kicked off 2023 under Islamic banking license from the SBP. FABL\u2019s operations are spread in 270 cities across the country with 700 branches offering Islamic corporate, commercial and consumer banking services. Daar Al Maal Al-Islami Trust (DMIT), the holding company of Ithmaar Holding B.S.C is the ultimate parent company of the bank.\n\nPattern of Shareholding\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, FABL has a total of 1517.696 million shares outstanding which are held by 16,260 shareholders. Associated companies, undertakings and related parties have the largest stake of 72.07 percent in the bank. This category is dominated by Ithmaar Bank B.S.C which holds 48 percent shares of FABL. Local general public accounts for 15.30 percent shares of the bank followed by Modarabas and Mutual Funds holding 3.21 percent shares. Banks, DFIs and NBFIs have a representation of 2.38 percent in the outstanding shares of the bank while Directors, CEO, their spouse and minor children own 1.70 percent shares of FABL. Foreign general public and insurance companies account for 1.48 and 0.57 percent shares respectively. The remaining shares are held by other categories of shareholders.\n\nHistorical Performance (2018-22)\n\nThe asset base of FABL has been posting steady growth since 2018. The growth came on the back of both advances and investments except in 2019 where investments posted a marginal 5 percent year-on-year downtick.AD ratio which clocked in at 78 percent in 2018 inched down to 60.59 percent in 2022, however is still much better than many industry counterparts.ID ratio which stood at 52 percent in 2018 climbed up to 60 percent in 2022. FABL\u2019s non-performing loans (NPLs) posted a year-on-year growth of 14 percent in 2019 and started shrinking thereafter. Infection ratio which stood at 8.33 percent in 2018 peaked in 2019 to clock in at 9.11 percent and then started ticking down since 2020 to stand at 4.58 percent in 2022. The bank has been maintaining adequate provisions for its NPLs. FABL\u2019s coverage ratio which stood at 86.69 percent in 2018 tumbled to 77.20 percent in 2019. While provisions kept growing in 2019, the drop in coverage ratio was on account of an increase in the NPLs during 2019. Since 2020, the coverage ratio took an upward flight to reach 85.62 percent in 2022. It is pertinent to note that Islamic financing and related assets which had a share of 25 percent in FABL\u2019s gross advances in 2018 staggeringly grew to 93 percent of its gross advances in 2022. Conversely, majority of FABL\u2019s NPLs are chipping in from conventional loans, cash credits and running finances. As of December 2022, only 23 percent of FABL\u2019s total NPLs of Rs. 21,698 million belonged to Islamic financing despite it having a lion\u2019s share in the gross advances portfolio of the bank. Delving into further details shows that Islamic financing and related assets have an infection ratio of 1.15 percent as of December 2022 while conventional financing portfolio has a whopping infection ratio of 52.38 percent as of December 2022.Better asset quality of Islamic financing might be the reason why FABL switched to a full-fledged Islamic bank from 2023. Sector-wise breakup of FABL\u2019s advances shows that as of December 2022, FABL had a major stake in textile sector which makes up 17.5 percent of its total advances. This is followed by power, gas, water and sanitary sector (15.5 percent) and individuals (11.8 percent).\n\nThe liabilities side of the bank also posted an unabated growth over the course of five years. The deposit base of FABL which stood at Rs.409,384 million in 2018 grew to Rs.781,571 million in 2022. The good part about deposit growth is that it came on the heels of current and saving accounts (CASA). The CASA ratio of the bank which stood at 68.83 percent in 2018 jumped up to 80 percent in 2022. However, in all the years under consideration, saving account deposits conveniently stayed above current account deposits. As of December 2022, current account deposits account for 35 percent of its total deposits while saving account deposits have s share of 45 percent in FABL\u2019s total deposits. Amidst current economic backdrop, where discount rate has reached an unprecedented level of 21 percent coupled with the imposition of MDR, saving deposits have turned to be very costly and hence not viable for any conventional bank.\n\nTalking about the financial performance, FABL\u2019s topline which posted a robust 64 percent year-on-year growth in 2019 plunged by 4 percent year-on-year each in 2020 and 2021 and then posted a strong rebound in 2022 where it grew by a stunning 94 percent year-on-year. While both advances and investments grew in 2020 and 2021, low discount rate played its trick to keep FABL\u2019s topline subdued in those two years. The spread ratio of FABL which stood at 46 percent in 2018 dropped to 36 percent in 2019. In the subsequent two years, it grew to reach 48 percent in 2021. However, it tumbled to 38 percent in 2022 owing to high share of saving deposits amidst monetary tightening and MDR.\n\nWhile Non-funded income of FABL posted growth since 2018; its share in total income of the bank which stood at 28.80 in 2018 massively dropped to 18.3 percent in 2022. This shows that over the course of years, FABL has been becoming overtly reliant on its markup income. The main contributors of non-funded income are fee and commission income, foreign exchange income and gain on securities. In 2020, during the outbreak of COVID-19, fee and commission income shrank by 6 percent year-on-year due to slowdown of economy which put pressure branch banking activities, card related fees, as well as consumer financing and commission fee. Dividend income, foreign exchange income and derivatives income also considerably dropped during 2020. Gain on securities worth Rs.1697 million came to the rescue which pushed the non-funded income up by 15 percent year-on-year in 2020. In 2022, when all the components of non-funded income boasted tremendous growth particularly fee and commission income which grew mainly on the back of card-related fee and foreign exchange income which grew on account of steep depreciation in the value of Pak Rupee, FABL posted a huge loss on securities worth Rs.1559.66 million which primarily includes the realized loss on investment in shares.\n\nAs the branch network of FABL is constantly growing, so are its operating expenses. In 2022, FABL branch network grew from 606 branches to 700 branches resulting in a 31 percent year-on-year surge in its operating expenses mainly on account of payroll expense followed by software maintenance fee, utility cost as well as security fee. An encouraging fact is that over the course of years, FABL\u2019s cost-to-income ratio has also ticked down from 65.97 percent in 2018 to 56.17 percent in 2022.\n\nFABL\u2019s bottomline has also been showing consistent growth since 2018 with the highest year-on-year growth of 38 percent recorded in 2022 culminating into a profit after tax of Rs.11,233 million and EPS of Rs.7.40 versus net profit of Rs.4,837 million and EPS of Rs.3.19 in 2018. However, PBT margin and PAT margin which had been following a downward trajectory since 2018 peaked to 25 percent and 15 percent respectively in 2021. In 2022, PBT and PAT margin ticked down to 21 percent and 10.7 percent respectively.\n\nRecent Performance (1QCY23)\n\nDuring 1QCY23, FABL\u2019s assets grew by 5.5 percent when compared to the year-end, December 2022. The growth came on the back of Islamic financing which grew by 7.3 percent while investments shrank by 0.5 percent when compared to the year-end numbers. While majority of FABL\u2019s financing was advanced in terms of Diminishing Musharaka and Running Musharaka, during 1QCY23, major growth was observed in Murabaha facilities. Besides, the bank also made advances against Wakala Istithmar which wasn\u2019t there until the bank hadn\u2019t converted into a full-fledge Islamic bank. NPLs marginally grew by 0.6 percent since December 2022, however, infection ratio dropped from 4.58 percent as of December 2022 to 4.30 percent as of March 2023. Coverage ratio stayed almost intact at 85.6 percent. FABL\u2019s AD ratio grew to 64 percent while ID ratio plummeted to 58 percent as of March 2023. This was despite the fact that there was no ADR based taxation from 2023 onwards. This shows the bank\u2019s inclinationtowards its core function of private sector lending when it could have easily parked its funds in risk-free government securities.\n\nDeposit base grew by 2.3 percent over year-end 2022. CASA grew by 9.8 percent while term deposits plunged by 28 percent during 1QCY23. Current account deposits stood at 37 percent of FABL\u2019s total deposits while saving account deposits had a share of 49 percent in the overall deposit base of FABL as of March 2023 which grew from 35 percent and 46 percent respectively over the quarter.\n\nFABL\u2019s mark-up income posted a staggering rise of 101 percent year-on-year in 1QCY23 which came on the back of high discount rate coupled with increased private sector lending. However, its gross spread ratio ticked down from 41.51 percent in 1QCY22 to 37.43 percent in 1QCY23. 115 percent year-on-year growth in mark-up expense mainly came on the back of securities sold under repurchase agreements and Musharaka acceptances besides mark-up expense on deposits.\n\nNon-markup income grew by 18 percent year-on-year in 1QCY23. While there was a tremendous growth in foreign exchange income as well as fee and commission income during the quarter, FABL recorded 644 percent year-on-year growth in the loss on securities which diluted the superb growth posted by other two components of non-funded income in 1QCY23. Non-funded income to total income also dropped from 22.95 percent in 1QCY22 to 16.17 percent in 1QCY23.\n\nFABL\u2019s cost-to-income ratio considerably improved from 64 percent in 1QCY22 to 51 percent in 1QCY23. The bottomline grew by 51 percent year-on-year in 1QCY23 to clock in at Rs.3211.15 million with an EPS of Rs.2.12. PBT and PAT margin which stood at 20 percent and 12 percent respectively in 1QCY22 inched down to 18 percent and 9 percent respectively in 1QCY23.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nBeing an Islamic bank, FABL is no longer required to comply with MDR on saving deposits which makes saving deposits less costly for the bank. This bodes well for the bank\u2019s spread ratio in the coming times which will be further strengthened by its growing focus on the private sector lending. However with growing advances, FABL needs to keep a strict eye on its asset quality and keep its infection ratio in check. The bank should also focus on the mobilization of non-remunerative deposits to have even stronger spread ratio in the coming times.",
