            "text": "The Bank of Punjab (BOP) has decided to join the ranks of other prominent banks in the country by establishing its wholly-owned exchange company with an authorized capital of Rs2.50 billion.\n\nIn a stock filing at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday, the Bank of Punjab said that its board, in their meeting held on October 28, 2023, has approved the establishment of an exchange company in the view of current market potential, future expansion, and recently introduced structural reforms by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in the exchange companies sector.\n\nHowever, establishing the exchange company is contingent upon approval from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and full compliance with pertinent laws and regulations.\n\nRead This: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nBOP\u2019s initiative is a crucial component of a wider campaign by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) aimed at curbing illicit activities within the underground market. The SBP has recently introduced structural reforms within the exchange company sector to enhance regulatory oversight, bolster governance frameworks, fortify internal controls, and tighten compliance protocols.\n\nFurthermore, the SBP has raised the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional stipulation that the capital must be unencumbered by prior losses.\n\nEarlier, major banks including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), Bank Alfalah (BAFL), Habib Metropolitan Bank and Askari Bank Limited announced to established their own forex companies.\n\nThe SBP has recently issued no-objection certificate (NOC) to ABL and MCB for establishing their exchange companies. Allied Bank\u2019s exchange company will be named ABL Exchange Company (Private) Limited and MCB\u2019s as MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

The dwindling inflows are set against the backdrop of import expenditures that are twice as high as exports.\n\nAmreen Soorani, head of research at JS Global, noted that the index had rallied by more than 60pc this year. \u201cTherefore, investors are bound to book profits at some point as witnessed since the past trade sessions,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cA correction after a sharp rise can be healthy for the market. The index is still undervalued and has upside on the cards, in addition to attractive dividend yield picks,\u201d she added.\n\nRaza Jafri, head of equities at Intermarket Securities, told Dawn.com that Pakistan was entering a \u201ccritical phase\u201d in the next few months where it would have to navigate elections and enter the successor International Monetary Fund programme in a \u201ctimely manner\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe remain positive across 2024, but there can be nervous days in the near term, especially given the market\u2019s quick run-up in the last few months,\u201d he said.",

            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed some productivity on Tuesday, although it failed to build on Monday\u2019s gains as investors continued grappling with uncertainty over the political scenario.\n\nThe trading session began positively, reaching an intraday high of 61,237.51 points before midday. However, the KSE-100 index couldn\u2019t sustain this momentum as investors struggled with warnings from Fitch regarding potential upheavals on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and dismal data on the current account deficit, which stood at $269 million in January 2024. Consequently, the index slipped below the 61,000 mark and eventually touched an intraday low of 60,420.83 points in its final trading hours.\n\nDespite this, Barclays remained optimistic, stating that Pakistan is unlikely to default on Eurobonds and praised the Sharif-led government for playing a less disruptive role. This aided the index to close on a positive note with some gains.\n\nNotably, in the pharmaceutical sector, stocks surged following news of deregulation on non-essential medication prices. \u201cStocks closed flat as investors weigh Fitch warnings over upheavals on IMF programme on political uncertainty and dismal data on the current account deficit at $269 million in January 2024,\u201d said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.\n\n\u201cBarclays overweight on Pakistan unlikely to opt default on Eurobonds and asserts Sharif-led government less disruptive played catalyst role in positive close.\u201d\n\nAt the close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded gains of 4.50 points, or 0.01%, settling at 60,464.24.\n\nTopline Securities noted in its report that the KSE-100 index opened positively, reaching an intraday high of 777.77 points. However, the index couldn\u2019t sustain the positivity, closing at 60,464.24 (+4.50 points).\n\n\u201cThe market sentiment soured amidst enduring political gridlock hampering the formation of the federal government and a dearth of favourable catalysts.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead PSX rebounds on political stability optimism\n\n\u201cIn the pharmaceutical domain, a surge ensued following news of the ministry\u2019s green light for deregulating the prices of non-essential medications,\u201d it said. Arif Habib Limited (AHL) observed in its report that the inability to build on Monday\u2019s gains saw the KSE-100 contained with HoD coming in at 61,237, well below 62,000 near term resistance.\n\n\u201c49 stocks rose and 42 fell with Hub Power Company (+1.99%), Systems Limited (+2.28%), and Pakistan State Oil (+3.65%) the biggest contributors to index gains while Oil and Gas Development Company (-2.18%), Pakistan Petroleum (-2.06%), and Mari Petroleum Company (-2.03%) the largest downside contributors,\u201d AHL added.\n\nJS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that the positive news flow on the political front regarding a resolution to form a government lifted the market. \u201cGoing forward, we recommend investors to avail any downside as an opportunity to buy in the banking and exploration and production (E&P) sectors,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nOverall trading volumes increased to 364.4 million shares against Monday\u2019s tally of 261.8 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs10.9 billion.\n\nShares of 349 companies were traded, with 174 stocks closing higher, 155 dropping, and 20 remaining unchanged. Bank of Punjab led in volume with trading in 117.02 million shares, gaining Rs0.25 to close at Rs6.27. It was followed by Pakistan International Airlines Corp with 19.3 million shares, gaining Rs0.04 to close at Rs11.10, and K-Electric with 19.2 million shares, losing Rs0.04 to close at Rs4.26.\n\nForeign investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs127.9 million, according to NCPL.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 21st, 2024.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",
