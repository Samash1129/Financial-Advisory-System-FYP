            "text": "Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Limited (SCBPL), a subsidiary of Standard Chartered Plc, posted earnings of Rs42.62 billion in 2023, up nearly 115% from the profit-after-tax Rs19.84 billion recorded in the same period of the preceding year.\n\nAs per SCBPL\u2019s latest financial results filed to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday, the earnings per share of the bank stood at Rs11.01 in 2023, an increase from Rs5.13 in 2022.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the bank also announced a final cash dividend at Rs2.5 per share i.e. 25%. This is in addition to the interim dividend already paid at Rs6.5 per share i.e. 65%.\n\nThe profit is attributed to a significant increase in net interest income and provisioning reversals.\n\nDuring the period, Standard Chartered earned interest amounting to Rs151.85 billion in 2023, from Rs90.43 billion in 2022, an increase of 68%.\n\nAs a result, the bank\u2019s net mark-up increased exponentially to Rs94.16 billion in 2023, as compared to Rs44.6 billion in 2022, up by 111%.\n\nIn 2023, SCBPL\u2019s fee and commission income clocked in at Rs5.52 billion, an increase of over 84% against Rs2.99 billion earned in the same period last year.\n\nThe bank saw its foreign exchange income dwindle massively to Rs5.7 billion in 2023, as compared to Rs9.5 billion in SPLY, reflecting a decline of 40%.\n\nDuring the period, the bank saw total income jump to Rs107.48 billion, up by 72%.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s non-interest expense rose to Rs18.43 billion in 2023, up 33% against Rs13.85 billion in SPLY.\n\nDuring the period, the firm reported a profit before tax of Rs89.22 billion, which increased by over 78%.\n\nIn 2023, SCBPL paid taxes to the tune of Rs46.6 billion as compared to Rs30.28 billion in the preceding year, a gain of 54%.",

            "text": "As the final trading session of 2023 approaches, data from the Pakistan Stock Exchange reveals a 54% increase in the benchmark of major shares in rupee terms. The total value of all shares has surged by 39%, reaching Rs9 trillion.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Topline Securities Ltd on Thursday, the best-performing sectors throughout the year include refinery, chemical, and power generation, with respective increases in their market capitalization of 88%, 73%, and 65%.\n\nIn contrast, property, modarabas, and textile spinning emerged as the worst-performing sectors, experiencing declines of 24%, 11%, and 7%, respectively.\n\nThe refinery sector\u2019s robust performance is attributed to positive expectations regarding the refinery policy. The chemical sector saw significant growth, led by Colgate-Palmolive Pakistan Ltd, which announced bonus shares, resulting in a 147% increase in the firm\u2019s market capitalization in 2023.\n\nThe power generation sector\u2019s performance was driven by a rally in Hub Power Company Ltd, witnessing an 88% increase in its market capitalization, while K-Electric Ltd also recorded a 76% increase in its market price.\n\nThe top-performing stock within the KSE-100 index for 2023 was Pak-Gulf Leasing Company, gaining 175%. This less-traded firm\u2019s success is attributed to a dividend of Rs3.50 per share and an 85% bonus in 2023.\n\nAttock Refinery Ltd followed closely, rising by 139% due to low valuation, positive expectations about the refinery policy, and a 49% year-on-year profitability growth in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nPakgen Power Ltd recorded a 123% gain in 2023, primarily due to a one-time bumper dividend of Rs15 per share in June. Standard Chartered Bank Pakistan Ltd and Pioneer Cement also experienced increases, with significant profitability growth of 121% and 262%, respectively, in the first three quarters of 2023. Hub Power Company Ltd gained 119%, partly attributed to a pay-out of Rs19.50 per share and the expected resolution of the circular debt.",

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Credit guarantee provider InfraZamin Pakistan and microfinance institution Kashf Foundation announced on Thursday the closing of South Asia\u2019s inaugural gender bond.\n\nIn a gong ceremony at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) Chairman Akif Saeed praised the stakeholders for coming up with that debt instrument that helped the microfinance provider raise Rs2.5 billion for onward lending.\n\nKashf Foundation launched the bond earlier this year along with a full credit guarantee by InfraZamin Pakistan, thereby safeguarding 100 per cent of the principal as well as two interest instalments. More than 30 institutional investors have subscribed to the bond.\n\nThis substantial participation from non-banking institutional investors, led by joint lead arrangers Arif Habib Ltd, the Bank of Punjab Ltd, Bank Alfalah Ltd and Standard Chartered Bank Ltd, serves as a positive indicator for Pakistan\u2019s capital market development, an official statement said. The instrument is priced at a three-month Kibor plus a 1.5 percentage-point spread for a three-year tenor. It\u2019ll soon be listed on the PSX.\n\nThe gender bond fully subscribes to the Guidelines of Gender Bond Issuance by the SECP, which are based on the UN Sustainable Development Goals and UN Women\u2019s principles for women empowerment.\n\nRecent SECP amendments have also facilitated this risk mitigation by allowing 85pc exemption to non-bank finance companies for exposures against InfraZamin\u2019s guarantees \u2014 similar to the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s exposure exemptions to commercial banks \u2014 along with other areas of support for mutual funds as well.\n\nThe bond proceeds are expected to boost Kashf\u2019s balance sheet, providing much-needed commercial capital to women from an underprivileged stratum. Kashf\u2019s microfinance lending portfolio will be enhanced to provide finance to 30,000 women from low-income and rural households to develop micro-infrastructure. This will enable them to pursue entrepreneurial aspirations, rehabilitate flood-affected homes, and expand schools and small businesses.\n\nInfraZamin Pakistan CEO Maheen Rahman said enhancing women\u2019s financial capacity, employment and independence is vital for economic progress. \u201cWith this gender bond, we have achieved all three.\n\nPublished in Dawn, December 1st, 2023",

            "short_description": "Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Limited - BR Research  Business Recorder",
            "text": "Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Limited (PSX: SCBPL) started off as Chartered Bank and inaugurated its first office in Karachi in 1863. The bank was incorporated in Pakistan in 2006. Standard Chartered Plc., incorporated in England, is the ultimate holding company of SCBPL. The bank has a network of 40 branches, 149 ATMs and 20 CDMs across 10 cities. SCBPL provides a wide range of Retail, Corporate and Institutional banking services. It also offers full suite of Islamic Banking services under its brand \u201cStandard Chartered Saadiq\u201d.\n\nPattern of Shareholding\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, SCBPL has a total of 3871.585 million shares outstanding which are held by 7012 shareholders. Parent company holds 98.99 percent shares of SCBPL. Local general public has a stake of 0.79 percent in the bank while Banks, DFIs and NBFIs account for 0.16 percent of the outstanding shares of SCBPL. The remaining shares are held by other categories of shareholders.\n\nHistorical Performance (2018-22)\n\nThe asset base of the bank has been showing steady growth in all the years under consideration with the highest year-on-year growth of 16 percent recorded in both 2020 and 2021. In 2020, when the economic activity was tamed due to COVID-19, SCBPL\u2019s advances slid by 15 percent year-on-year. However, investment portfolio of the bank surged by a significant 40 percent year-on-year in 2020 which contributed a great deal in building up the asset base of the bank during the year. This took the AD ratio of the bank to 32 percent in 2020, down from 47 percent in the previous year. Conversely, ID ratio climbed up to 63 percent in 2021 from 53.5 percent in 2019. In 2021, when the signs of COVID-19 began to taper, advances and investments grew by a comparable momentum of 28 percent and 29 percent year-on-year respectively. However, it is to be noted that in all the years under consideration, SCBPL has adopted a cautious lending approach and has conveniently parked its funds in government securities. This is evident from the fact that its ID ratio is well above its AD ratio in all the years under consideration. Moreover, AD ratio deteriorated from 40 percent in 2018 to 30 percent in 2019. ID ratio showed some fluctuations over the years but hovers at almost the same level in 2022 as in 2018 i.e. around 66 percent. It is pertinent to note that SCBPL didn\u2019t elevate its AD ratio even when the banking sector was slapped with higher taxation on government securities for the AD ratio lesser than 40 percent. The lack of borrowing appetite of the private sector on the back of worsening economic and political parameters are also to be blamed for a 7 percent year-on-year downtick in SCBPL\u2019s advances in 2022. As deposits grew by a considerable 15 percent year-on-year in 2022, SCBPL appeared to be left with no other option than to invest in government securities. For the first time in the banking history, bankers were trying to shed their deposits by pleading their customers to withdraw their deposits instead of asking them for more deposits. While this was against the very essence of banking, the bankers were in a pickle on how to mobilize their deposits without compromising on their AD ratio amidst lackluster economic activity and lesser lending avenues in the private sector. The AD ratio of 47 percent recorded by the bank in 2019 was the highest since 2015. The ID ratio touted its highest value of 72 percent in 2021 since 2015. Majority of SCBPL\u2019s lending exposure stays in the corporate sector which is considered to be the safest bet.\n\nWith such a vigilant lending approach, NPLs of the bank have started plunging since 2021 after growing by a massive 28 percent year-on-year in 2020 as COVID-19 had crippled the economy, rendering many businesses incapable of paying back their loans. This took the infection ratio to 11.3 percent in 2020 which is the highest among all the years under consideration. This went down to 8 percent in 2021 and then rested at 9 percent in 2022. In 2018 and 2019, SCBPL was booking reversals as its infection ratio was ticking down and it was maintaining a coverage ratio of around 97 percent which was more than what was required under the regulation. However, the sudden hike in the NPLs in 2020 pushed the coverage ratio down to 84 percent despite the fact that the bank booked the provision of Rs.4940.71 million in 2020. With the exception of 2020, in all the years under consideration, SCBPL maintains a coverage ratio above 90 percent.\n\nOn the liabilities front, deposits ride an upward trajectory in all the years under consideration with CASA ratio growing from 94 percent in 2018 to 96 percent in 2022. With multiple upward revisions in the discount rate and with the presence of minimum deposit rate, saving account deposits are no longer lucrative for the conventional banks. The break-up of CASA shows that since 2019, saving deposits conveniently stays above the current deposits. In 2022, CA ratio clocked in at 46 percent while SA ratio stood at 50 percent. The bank needs to reassess the composition of its CASA in order to elevate its spreads and make the most of the monetary tightening scenario.\n\nA sneak into the financial performance of SCBPL shows that except for a marginal 1 percent year-on-year growth in 2020 and a year-on-year decline of 7 percent in 2021 due to COVID-19 related monetary easing as well as vigilant lending, the net spread of the bank have showed staggering growth. In 2022, the net spread boasted a stunning 70 percent year-on-year growth; however, the spread ratio fell from 56 percent in 2021 to 49 percent in 2022 \u2013 thanks to MDR. SCBPL touted the highest spread ratio of 60 percent in 2019. Non-fund based income which had been growing since 2018 took a 13 percent year-on-year nosedive in 2021 due to considerable decline in fee and commission income, gain on securities and derivatives income. However, non-funded income gave a strong comeback in 2022, touting a 62 percent year-on-year growth which came on the heels of a handsome foreign exchange income and income from derivatives. It is to be noted that non-markup income to total income has fallen from 34 percent in 2018 to 29 percent in 2022. One reason for this is the robust markup income which dilutes the share of non-markup income in the total income pie. Another reason is the visible fall in the fee and commission income over the years due to decline in the card-related fee. Fee and commission income which had a share of 43 percent in the total non-funded income in 2018 fell to 17 percent of the total non-funded income in 2022.\n\nSCBPL deserves a pat on the back to considerably improve its cost-to-income ratio from 40 percent in 2018 to 22 percent in 2022. Net profit also rides an ascending path in all the years under consideration except for an 18 percent year-on-year fall in 2020. In 2022, the profit after tax posted a magnificent growth of 45 percent year-on-year to clock in at Rs.19,844.38 million with an EPS of Rs.5.13 despite higher taxation imposed on the sector.\n\nRecent Performance (1QCY23)\n\nDuring 1QCY23, SCBPL\u2019s assets grew by 3 percent over December 2022. The growth came on the back of advances which inched up by 5 percent over the year-end figure. Conversely, investments fell by 22 percent when compared to December 2022. This pushed the AD ratio up to 34 percent as of March 2023, while ID ratio drastically fell to 51 percent. NPLs posted a meager uptick of 1 percent in 1QCY23, however, infection ratio slightly ticked down to 8.6 percent. Coverage ratio stood at 94 percent in 1QCY23.\n\nDeposits posted a marginal 1 percent growth over December 2022 level which came on the back of current deposits which grew by 22 percent while saving deposits fell by 12 percent. Not only did the CASA ratio improved to 98 percent in 1QCY23, what is more exciting is CA ratio in excess of SA ratio. CA ratio flew to 55 percent as of March 2023 while SA ratio plunged to 43 percent which is a good omen amidst MDR on saving deposits.\n\nNet markup grew by a massive 140 percent year-on-year in 1QCY23 and spread ratio also visibly improved from 50 percent in 1QCY22 to 60 percent in 1QCY23. Non-funded income drastically fell by 88 percent year-on-year in 1QCY23 on the back of a substantial loss on securities (Pakistan Investment bond to be specific). Foreign exchange income and derivatives income also fell by 69 percent and 32 percent respectively in 1QCY23. This shoved the non-markup income to total income down from 43 percent in 1QCY22 to 3.44 percent in 1QCY23. The poor performance of non-funded income diluted the growth of total income in 1QCY23 which came out to be 43 percent year-on-year despite tremendous growth in NIM. Cost to income ratio further improved from 23 percent in 1QCY22 to 20 percent in 1QCY23. The net profit grew by 30 percent year-on-year in 1QCY23 to clock in at Rs.9190.64 million with an EPS of Rs.2.37 versus Rs.1.82 during the same period last year.\n\nFuture Outlook\n\nWith the current deposits now having a lion\u2019s share in the total deposits and advances slightly ticking up, SCBPL is all set to optimize the monetary tightening scenario. Moreover, majority of SCBPL\u2019s assets have a short-term maturity which mean that any further rate hike will provide an immediate benefit to the bank by driving up its markup income.",
