            "text": "KARACHI: The equities market turned in a robust performance in the first outgoing week of the new calendar year thanks to positive developments on the economic front.\n\nArif Habib Ltd said the stock market displayed notable resilience, experiencing a significant surge of 2,211 points on Monday, recording the second-highest absolute point increase and marking the highest surge on the first working day of a new year.\n\nMoreover, positive economic indicators were evident as the Federal Board of Revenue achieved a historic one-month tax collection of Rs984bn, coupled with a substantial 40.1 per cent year-on-year reduction in the trade deficit for December 2023. However, an elevated level of headline inflation number of December at 29.7pc year-on-year raised some investor concerns.\n\nOn a positive note, the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s reserves reached $8.2bn, the highest level since July 14, 2023. Moreover, the rupee strengthened by 0.16pc against the US dollar, clocking in at Rs281.4.\n\nHence, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,515 points after gaining 2,064 points or 3.3pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise positive contributions came from oil and gas exploration companies (587 points), commercial banks (392 points), fertiliser (315 points), cement (185 points), and power generation and distribution (166 points). Sectors that contributed negatively were miscellaneous (13 points), glass & ceramics (3.2 points), investment banks (1.3 points), modarbas (one point) and leasing companies (0.1 points).\n\nScrip-wise positive contributors were Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (268 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (258 points), Fauji Fertiliser Company (151 points), Hub Power Company Ltd (120 points), and United Bank Ltd (102 points). Meanwhile, scrip-wise negative contributions came from Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans Ltd (12 points), Askari Bank Ltd (6 points), Ghani Glass Ltd (4.8 points), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (4.5 points), and BankIslami Pakistan Ltd (3.6 points).\n\nForeign selling clocked in at $3.1m compared to $1.9m in the preceding week. Major selling was witnessed in exploration and production ($1.95m) and banks ($1m).\n\nOn the local front, buying was reported by other organisations ($5.5m) and banks ($5.4m). Average daily volume arrived at 687m shares, up by 5.4pc week-on-week. The average daily value settled at $69.6m, up by 11.6pc from the preceding week.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd observed that the surge in the benchmark KSE 100-share can largely be attributed to aggressive institutional buying after the IMF announced its executive board is meeting on Jan 11 to approve $700m tranche for Pakistan.\n\nGoing forward, AKD Securities Ltd said the market is anticipated to maintain its bullish momentum, fuelled by the disbursement of the IMF second tranche. The forthcoming elections will be closely watched, and uncertainty surrounding their outcome could potentially hinder the market\u2019s bullish trend.\n\nHowever, a peaceful resolution could provide a significant boost to investor confidence. Our recommendation to investors is to maintain long-term positions in companies with strong fundamentals while tactfully managing any fundamentally weak entities through a timely profit-taking strategy.\n\nAdditionally, companies offering robust dividend yields, especially in the banking, energy, and fertiliser sectors, present opportunities for accumulation, noted AKD Securities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2024",

            "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) suspended the trading of multiple companies on regulatory non-compliance, ranging from non-payment of dues to not holding annual general meetings to non-submission of the annual audited financial statements.\n\nAccording to notices issued on January 12, these companies failed to comply with the regulatory clause(s) 5.11.1 of PSX regulation that falls under the heading of defaulters\u2019 segment, suspension and de-listing.\n\nMohammad Farooq Textile, Gulistan Textile, Haydari Construction, Huffaz Seamless Pipe Industries and Silver Star Insurance got shares trading suspension due to reasons, including failing to hold the annual general meeting and non-submission of the annual audited financial statements.\n\nClause 5.11.1 (c) of the PSX regulations suggests that a company should hold its one annual general meeting as per law, and clause 5.11.1 (d) suggests that a company should submit its annual audited accounts for the preceding financial year.\n\nAs per PSX notice, Saudi Pak Leasing Company was stopped from trading because it suspended commercial production/business operations in its principal line of business for a continuous period of one year. It also violated rules regarding payment of dues of the exchange. SECP cancelled its Non-Banking Finance Company (NBFC) and issued a show cause notice initiating a Winding-up proceeding.\n\nSimilarly, Progressive Insurance Company was also suspended from trading due to non-payment of dues, suspension of commercial business, and a winding-up petition filed by the SECP.\n\nZahur Cotton Mills got a suspension of shares because it suspended commercial production/business operations in its principal line of business and non-induction of its Ordinary Shares into the Central Depository System (CDS).\n\nThe PSX took the decision to suspend shares trading in the exercise of the powers vested in the Exchange under Sub-Section (7) of Section 19 of the Securities Act, 2015 and clause 5.11 of the PSX Regulations.\n\nAdditionally, United Bank Limited announced the dates of Book Closure from January 21, 2024, to January 28, 2024, for the 20th profit payment of their Term Finance Certificate (TFC).\n\nGiven the above, trading in the said TFC will be suspended from January 19, 2024, to January 28, 2024, and will resume on January 29, 2024.",

            "text": "The Board of Directors of United Bank Limited (PSX: UBL) has approved the establishment of an exchange company with Rs. 1 billion as paid-up capital, the commercial bank informed the Pakistan Stock Exchange on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to a stock filing, the exchange company will be categorized as a wholly-owned subsidiary of UBL subject to approval by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and other regulatory compliances.\n\nThis comes after last week\u2019s relentless crackdown against black market agents, and the subsequent announcement by SBP to introduce structural reforms in the Exchange Companies\u2019 sector. As part of these reforms, leading banks actively engaged in foreign exchange business will establish wholly owned Exchange Companies to cater to the legitimate foreign exchange needs of the general public.\n\nThe minimum capital requirement for Exchange Companies has been increased from Rs. 200 million to Rs. 500 million.\n\nThese reforms are expected to strengthen governance, internal controls, and compliance culture in the sector, the central bank said in its statement.\n\nPertinently, the same central bank in May 2023 caught commercial banks red-handed for their role in the depreciation of the PKR. Businesses expected these financial institutions to be punished and barred from unrestrained access to the currency business but the regulator simply sent them away with a slap on the wrist and a clean chit.\n\nToday, UBL has announced to set up an exchange company; other banks are expected to soon follow suit.\n\nUNBL UK\n\nBesides the exchange company, the UBL BoD accorded its approval of an \u201cIndicative Offer\u201d received from Bestway Group (BG) to acquire the entire shareholding of UBL in UNBL UK. Currently, UBL owns 55 percent shares in UNBL UK.\n\nUNBL UK contributed an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of Rs 0.57 to the Consolidated EPS of UBL for the Half Year ended June 30, 2023. For full-year 2022 the EPS contribution of UNBL UK to the Consolidated EPS of UBL stood at Rs 0.48 per share.\n\nThe Risk Weighted Assets of UNBL UK stood at Rs, 339.2 billion as of June 30th, 2023 with a downward impact of 200 basis points to the Consolidated Capital Adequacy Ratio of UBL.\n\nThe above approval of the Board of Directors of UBL is subject to the approval/clearance by SBP and all other regulatory compliances required in this regard in both Pakistan and the UK.\n\nUNBL UK is a banking institution incorporated in the United Kingdom. UNBL UK was formed in 2001 from the merger of the UK branches of United Bank Limited and the National Bank of Pakistan.\n\nThe principal activities of UNBL UK are to provide retail banking, wholesale banking and treasury services to financial institutions and trade finance facilities to businesses of all sizes. UNBL UK operates one branch inside the United Kingdom under the trade name of United Bank UK.\n\nAccording to a report by Topline Securities, As of 1H2023, UBL\u2019s consolidated Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR) stood at 14.81%, whereas the unconsolidated CAR stood at 16.92%. In 1H2023 CBS, management mentioned that the difference is due to the rupee devaluation and its impact on its subsidiaries outside Pakistan.\n\nAfter the successful completion of this deal, it will have a positive impact of 200bps on its consolidated CAR, bringing it closer to the levels of the unconsolidated CAR, as per our channel checks, said the brokerage house.\n\nTopline believes that the upward revision in CAR will increase the bank\u2019s dividend-paying capacity in the future.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Silkbank is once again in the talks of the town. According to a filing to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) shared by the Silk Bank, United Bank Limited (UBL) has expressed interest in a potential merger with Silkbank Limited.\n\n\u201cThe potential merger will remain subject to due diligence, internal and regulatory approvals and definitive documents,\u201d it said.\n\n\u201cThe Board of Directors of the bank has reviewed and considered the UBL proposal and granted its approval to the management of the bank to formally pursue the potential merger and take the required steps, including but not limited to seeking permission of State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) for allowing due diligence of the bank and to enter into discussions with UBL, to finalise the terms and conditions/documentation for placing before the Board, for its consideration and approval, if considered appropriate,\u201d it added.\n\nWhat is in it for UBL?\n\nSilkbank, formerly the Saudi-Pak Commercial Bank, is primarily focused on the consumer segment with a portfolio of services consisting of consumer loans, and credit cards. The smallest bank of Pakistan manages a good credit card and personal loan portfolio and has sound Shariah-compliant products. UBL could expand its outreach by merging with Silkbank. It could merge its Islamic banking operations with Silkbank to appease the ever growing demand for Shariah-compliant financial products.\n\nWhat is in it for Silkbank?\n\nSilkbank has been making losses for a few years now. The bank reported a profit of Rs 13.2 billion in 2018. Thereafter, it reported a net loss of Rs 3.95 billion in 2019 which increased to Rs 6.57 billion at the end of 2020. Its accumulated losses amounted to Rs 20.27 billion at the end of 2020, the latest period for which the bank has published its financial accounts.\n\nIts capital stood at Rs 3.16 billion against the prescribed minimum capital requirement of Rs 10 billion at the end of 2020. Similarly, its capital adequacy ratio was -4.45% against the prescribed level of 11.5% on Dec 31, 2020.\n\nNeedless to say that the bank is in desperate need of new capital to meet regulatory requirements. Earlier this year, Silkbank said in a press release that the bank is on a growth trajectory. But annual reports have not been made available to the public.\n\nOrganisations that expressed interest in Silkbank\n\nSilkbank has a history of drawing the attention of investors and UBL has emerged as the third potential investor in a short span of time.\n\nLast month, the International Commercial Bank (ICB), a South Sudanese bank, expressed its intention to invest up to 50 million euros (equivalent to Rs 15.4 billion) in Silkbank.\n\nLater on, Pakistan Housing Finance Company (PHFC), a subsidiary of Lake City Limited and a leading consortium of an investor group, supported and backed by the renowned management of Burj Capital, which carries the required experience of setting up and successfully managing Islamic and conventional banks in Pakistan, proposed an investment of up to Rs 12 billion into Silkbank Limited\u2019s equity.\n\nAmongst the local investors that expressed interest in the bank include Fauji Foundation. In early 2021, Fauji Foundation, which has a stake in Askari Bank, expressed interest to acquire a major stake in Silk Bank. When it lost interest, Habib Bank and Bank Alfalah became interested in acquiring Silk Bank\u2019s consumer portfolio in mid-2021. In May 2022, Park View Enclave (Private) Limited, owned by businessman and politician Aleem Khan, expressed interest in acquiring 51% of the stake in Silk Bank which also withdrew its intention in October 2022, citing a change in its business priorities.\n\nWho has stakes in Silk Bank?\n\nAccording to Silk Bank\u2019s latest annual report for the year ending December 2020, around 62.91% of the bank\u2019s shares are held by associated companies and related parties. This can be further categorized as the Arif Habib Corporation holds 28.23%, Shaukat Tarin holds 11.55%, the International Finance Corporation holds 7.74%, Zulqurnain Nawaz Chattha 7.76%, Nomura European Investment Ltd 3.93%, Bank Muscat holds 3.48% and Azmat Shahzad Ahmed Tarin holds 0.22%.\n\nSeparately, the directors and chief executive hold 4.62% of the bank\u2019s shares.",
