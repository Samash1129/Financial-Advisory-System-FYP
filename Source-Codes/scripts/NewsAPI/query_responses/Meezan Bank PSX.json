            "text": "KARACHI: The overwhelming success of the first-ever auction of Ijarah Sukuk on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) in the outgoing week has given rise to speculations that depositors are likely to withdraw their investments from Islamic banks and invest directly in government debt for better returns.\n\nAs opposed to the earlier practice where only commercial banks would place bids for the government debt, its auction on the PSX allows the general public to bypass banks and directly make risk-free investments.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn on Saturday, Meezan Bank Ltd Senior Executive Vice President Ahmed Ali Siddiqui said he doesn\u2019t expect a drop in the deposits of Islamic banks on the pretext of depositors moving their funds from savings accounts to the PSX.\n\n\u201cMost people maintain savings accounts for daily transactions. They don\u2019t keep their money with us for investment purposes,\u201d said the representative of the country\u2019s largest Islamic bank with deposits of over Rs2 trillion.\n\nPakistan Domestic Sukuk Company Ltd, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Ministry of Finance, issued the one-year Ijarah Sukuk with the Islamabad portion of Islamabad Metro as its underlying asset. Unlike conventional debt that\u2019s raised on the word of the sovereign, Ijarah Sukuk generate funds by leasing out physical assets like highways, airports, dams, power plants or large public parks.\n\nInvestors, particularly the general public, participated in the maiden auction so enthusiastically that the realised amount clocked in at a whopping Rs396.3 billion for the offer size of only Rs30bn. The cut-off yield remained 19.5 per cent \u2014 which is 1.9 percentage points lower than the one-year conventional treasury bill cut-off rate of 21.4pc witnessed in the last auction, according to Topline Securities CEO Mohammed Sohail.\n\nMr Siddiqui of Meezan Bank Ltd said depositors of Islamic banks wishing to \u201cinvest\u201d their funds are offered tailor-made products that pay profit rates that\u2019re comparable to other investment options.\n\n\u201cThose products are separate from our savings accounts,\u201d he said, insisting that easier access to direct investment in government debt won\u2019t lead to depositors moving their funds to the PSX.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Al Meezan Investment Management Ltd CEO Mohammad Shoaib said the Islamic asset management industry welcomes the auction of Islamic bonds on the PSX platform because it\u2019ll popularise Islamic instruments of debt among the general public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a misconception that customers of Sharia-compliant asset management companies (AMCs) will switch to direct investing in Sukuk via their brokerage accounts. AMCs are the go-to option for retail investors globally, and Pakistan is no exception,\u201d said the CEO of the AMC with assets under management of roughly Rs400bn.\n\nPublished in Dawn, December 10th, 2023",

This is in addition to interim Dividend(s) already paid at Rs7 per share i.e. 70%.\n\nThe increase in profit was led by sharp spike in profit/return earned on Islamic financing and related assets, investments and placements.\n\nThe net profit/return rose from Rs31.75 billion in 1QFY23 to Rs64.08 billion in 1QFY24, a robust increase of nearly 102%.\n\nThe fee and commission income earned by the bank in 1QFY23 amounted to Rs5.21 billion, a surge of 37% against Rs3.8 billion earned in the same period last year.\n\nHowever, the dividend income of the firm showed a decline of over 11% down from Rs128.5 million in 1QFY23 to Rs113.4 million in 1QFY24.\n\nMeezan Bank\u2019s foreign exchange income increased significantly by 83% from Rs734.7 million to Rs1.6 billion in 1QFY24.\n\nAdditional income earned by Meezan Bank also jumped by 115% as it increased to Rs411.5 million in 1QFY24 from Rs191.3 million in SPLY.\n\nDuring 1QFY24, operating expenses of the firm amounted to Rs18.68 billion, up 50% against Rs12.44 billion in SPLY.\n\nThe firm reported a sharp hike in expenditure on worker welfare fund which almost doubled during the period. Meezan Bank spent Rs511.3 million under this head in 1QFY23 and Rs1.06 billion in 1QFY24.",

            "text": "KARACHI: The government is set to raise Rs150 billion through the auction of one-, three-, and five-year fixed and floating rate local currency Sukuk, or Islamic bonds, at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on February 20.\n\nA trader can be seen at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) building in Karachi. \u2014 PPI/File\n\nThe auction will be held for five denominations of Sukuk: one-year discounted Government of Pakistan Ijarah Sukuk (GIS), three-year variable rate, three-year fixed rate, five-year variable rate, and five-year fixed rate Sukuk, according to an auction calendar issued by the PSX.\n\nMeezan Bank Limited is leading the transaction as a joint financial adviser and Shariah adviser for the issue of Sukuk, along with Dubai Islamic Bank Pakistan, BankIslami Pakistan Limited, and Bank Alfalah Islamic.\n\nThis will be the third issuance through PSX, after successful issuances in December 2023 and January 2024, where the government was able to raise approximately Rs30 billion and Rs80 billion respectively.\n\nThe Sukuk auction will provide investors an opportunity to invest in a Shariah-compliant instrument and earn returns of up to approximately 20 percent with investments as low as Rs5,000 only.\n\nIn contrast to conventional interest-based Treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds, bankers stated that the government is diversifying its funding sources and reducing considerable debt costs with the successful issuance of Sukuk through the local bourse.\n\nAlong with this, there appears to be a shift towards Shariah-compliant financing, after the Federal Shariat Court's directive to remove Riba/interest from the financial system by December 2027.\n\nBankers said the one-year discounted Ijarah Sukuk will be under fresh issuance, while the issuance of three\n\nand five-year variable and fixed rate bonds will be against the reopening of Sukuk issued in the January 2024\n\nauction. This will be the first time a Sukuk will be reopened through auction at PSX.\n\nReopening of Sukuk is similar to that of issuance of a completely new Sukuk, where the transaction is concluded by purchasing additional shares in the identified asset, which is then leased out via a separate Ijarah agreement executed with the government.\n\nIn case of reopening, the investors bid on the purchase price of the Sukuk instead of the rental rate (which is the usual practice), as the rental rate is kept the same as announced for the initial issue, which is being reopened.\n\nThe underlying asset, maturity date, rental rate, and rental payout frequency of the reopened Sukuk are kept the same as that of the initial issue.",
