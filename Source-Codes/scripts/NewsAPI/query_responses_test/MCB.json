The Board of Directors has declared final cash dividend of Rs. 9.0 per share i.e. 90%, in addition to 210% already paid, bringing the total cash dividend for the year 2023 to 300%.\n\nThrough focused efforts of the Bank\u2019s management in building no-cost deposits and\n\noptimizing its earning assets mix, MCB achieved significant growth in core earnings to post a historic Profit Before Tax (PBT) of Rs. 125.2 billion; registering an impressive increase of\n\n75% over last year. The Profit After Tax (PAT) was recorded at Rs. 59.6 billion (+82%) and\n\ntranslated into an Earning Per Share (EPS) of Rs. 50.32 compared to an EPS of Rs. 27.63\n\nreported in the last year.\n\nAided by a strong volumetric growth in current account and timely repositioning of the asset book, net interest income for the year 2023 increased by 69% as compared to last year.\n\nNon-markup income increased to Rs. 32.9 billion (+34%) against Rs. 24.6 billion in the last\n\nyear with major contributions coming in from fee commission income (Rs. 20.2 billion),\n\nincome from dealing in foreign currency (Rs. 8.5 billion) and dividend income (Rs. 3.0\n\nbillion).\n\nImproving customer and interbank flows, diversification of revenue streams through\n\ncontinuous enrichment of service suite, investments towards digital transformation and an\n\nunrelenting focus on upholding high standards of service delivery supplemented a broad-\n\nbased growth of 43% in income from fee commission; with trade and guarantee related\n\nbusiness income growing by 111%, cards related income by 49%, branch banking customer fees by 14% and income from home remittance by 26%.\n\nThe Bank continues to manage an efficient operating expense base and monitor costs\n\nprudently.

The cost to income ratio of the Bank improved significantly to 29% from\n\n37% reported in the last year.\n\nNavigating a challenging operating and macroeconomic environment, the Bank has been\n\naddressing asset quality issues by maintaining discipline in management of its risk return\n\ndecisions. Diversification of loan book across customer segments and a robust credit\n\nunderwriting framework that encompasses structured assessment models, effective pre-\n\ndisbursement evaluation tools and an array of post disbursement monitoring systems has\n\nenabled MCB to effectively manage its credit risk; the Non-performing loan (NPLs) base of\n\nthe Bank was reported at Rs. 53.9 billion as at December 31, 2023. The coverage and\n\ninfection ratios of the Bank were reported at 82.70% and 8.66% respectively.\n\nOn the financial position side, the total asset base of the Bank grew by 16% and was\n\nreported at Rs. 2.43 trillion.

The average current to\n\ntotal deposits ratio improved to 50.5% in the year 2023 as compared to 42.2% in the last\n\nyear.

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "KARACHI: The stock market turned in a cautious performance on Monday ahead of the monetary policy announcement as a result the benchmark index managed to post modest gains with a sharp contraction in the trading volume.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the equities kicked off the week on a positive note as the benchmark KSE 100 index rose 332 to 65,148 points in early trade amid hopes of a positive outcome of the ongoing IMF final review under the current $3bn Stand-By Arran\u00adgement, which would pave the way for the release of last tranche of $1.1bn.\n\nHowever, the uncertain interest rate outlook unsettled a section of investors who resorted to profit-taking at the day\u2019s high level resultantly the index lost some of its initial gains.\n\nThe equity investors adopted a cautious approach ahead of the monetary policy announcement, which was to be unveiled later in the day. A majority of market pundits were expecting a status quo given the ongoing IMF review of the economy and spike in Ramazan-driven inflationary pressure.\n\nFertiliser, banks and power sectors contributed positively to the index as Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank Ltd, Hub Power, United Bank Ltd Dawood Hercules cumulatively added 141 points to the index. On the other hand, Lucky Cement, Systems Ltd and MCB Bank came under heavy selling wiping out 72 points.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the surging global crude oil prices and strong rupee helped the market to remain in the green.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,890.51 points after gaining 74.04 points or 0.11 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading tumbled 18.35pc to 211.75 million shares. The traded value also declined 23.07pc to Rs7.78bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom (16.60m shares), Hascol Petroleum Ltd (16.26m shares), Telecard Ltd (14.67m shares), PTCL (13.81m shares) and K-Electric (12.95m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Pakistan Hotels (Rs19.98), Pakistan Tobacco (Rs11.00), Thal Ltd (Rs8.98), KASB Pumps (Rs5.20) and Bolan Castings (Rs6.46).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Ismail Industries (Rs60.00), Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs35.83), JDW Sugar (Rs20.90), Colgate Palm\u00adolive (Rs19.17) and Sazgar Engineering (Rs15.64).\n\nForeign investors rema\u00adined net buyers as they purchased shares worth $0.39m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 19th, 2024",
