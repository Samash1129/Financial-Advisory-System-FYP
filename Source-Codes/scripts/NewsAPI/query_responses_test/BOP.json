            "text": "Banking stocks are in focus after Nifty Bank hit a record high in trade today (December 15) on the back of overall positive market sentiment. The US Fed maintaining interest rate in the last policy meeting of 2023 as well as signaling rate cuts in 2024 led to a surge in the market. Moreover, the continuous foreign investor inflow, RBI holding rates, GDP growth coming better than expected in the September quarter as well as the improving global macros have also been aiding the sentiment.\n\nThe Indian banks delivered healthy earnings during the second quarter of FY24, but the performance was marked by slowing momentum. The lenders reported net profit growth of 33 percent year-on-year (YoY) led by a reduction in credit costs. Analysts believe the lenders are entering a period of low revenue growth for H2FY24 as the cost of funds is yet to peak for all players.\n\nAsset quality is unlikely to be a concern for most banks in the medium term unless there is a sharp macroeconomic downturn\u2014a relatively low probability event.\n\nAmid this backdrop, between private sector lender Axis Bank and public sector lender Punjab National Bank (PNB), which one has better long-term investment opportunities?\n\nStock Price Trend\n\nBoth Axis Bank and PNB have outperformed the benchmark this year so far. While PNB has performed better, surging over 59 percent in 2023 YTD, Axis Bank has jumped 20 percent. In comparison, the Nifty Bank has added 11 percent and Nifty has advanced 17 percent in this period.\n\nDespite the better performance, PNB has been in the green in only 6 of the 12 months this year versus Axis's 8 months of positive returns.\n\nPNB surged the most in September, up 27.3 percent and shed the most in February, down 9.7 percent. Axis Bank, on the other hand, has gained the most in November, up 9.4 percent and lost the most in October, down 5.3 percent.\n\nJust in December, PNB has soared almost 16 percent as compared to a 4.3 percent rise in Axis.\n\nMeanwhile, in the last 1 year, PNB has rallied almost 52 percent whereas Axis Bank surging over 19 percent as against an over 8 percent gain in Nifty Bank and over 12 percent increase in Nifty.\n\nPNB hit its 52-week high of \u20b991.81 in today's session (December 15). It has now advanced over 105 percent from its 52-week low of \u20b944.41, hit on March 28, 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, Axis Bank hit its record high of \u20b91,151.50 earlier this month on December 5, 2023. Currently trading at \u20b91,120, it has advanced over 37 percent from its 52-week low of \u20b9814.25, hit on March 16, 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, in the long term, 3 years as well, PNB has emerged as the winner. The stock has given multibagger returns, skyrocketing over 123 percent while Axis Bank has rallied around 85 percent. In comparison, the Bank Nifty and Nifty increased by 55 percent and 56 percent, respectively.\n\nEarnings\n\nIn the September quarter, private lender Axis Bank reported a net profit of \u20b95,863 crore, registering a 10 percent YoY growth, while net interest income (NII) rose 18.9 percent to \u20b912,314.56 crore. Net interest margin (NIM) during the quarter increased by 1 basis point sequentially and 15 basis points YoY to 4.11 percent.\n\nAxis Bank's asset quality improved sequentially. For the quarter ended September, gross non-performing assets (NPA) stood at \u20b916,756.7 crore vs \u20b918,158.2 crore, down 7.7 percent. Net NPA came in at \u20b93,441.3 crore, down 7.1 percent sequentially.\n\nMeanwhile, the state-run lender PNB posted robust performance for the September quarter (Q2FY24), beating analyst estimates, with a 20 percent YoY and 4.4 percent QoQ surge in net interest income (NII) to \u20b99,923 crore in Q2FY24, while the net interest margin (Domestic) came in at 3.24 percent against 3.11 percent in Q2FY23 and 3.21 percent in Q1FY24.\n\nOn the asset quality front, the gross NPA ratio of the bank dropped to 6.96 percent in Q2FY24 compared to 10.48 percent in Q2FY23, while the net NPA ratio stood at 1.47 percent in Q2FY24, down from 3.80 percent in Q2FY23.\n\nWhich lender has better long-term opportunities?\n\nJignesh Shial, Director - Research; Head of BFSI Sector at InCred Capital, likes Axis Bank over PNB.\n\nFor the long term, our preference remains with Axis Bank over PNB. We like Axis due to its better ROA/ROE structure, better underwriting history, superior technology platform, and well-diversified book.\n\nAxis being a private bank makes a superior ROA of 1.6-1.8 percent over PNB's ROA of 0.6-0.8% which along with superior credit growth than PNB augurs well for long-term wealth creation for investors. Although PNB trades at a lower valuation of 1.4x P/BV against Axis Valuation of 2.5x, we believe this discount of PNB will be sustained in the long term especially when the higher credit growth or the low NPA cycle turns.\n\nThus we believe for long-term value creation investors should stick to Axis Bank which has a better ROA/ROE structure, and growth potential and will continue to gain market share from PSBs.\n\nVeer Trivedi, Research Analyst, SAMCO Securities, also leans towards Axis Bank.\n\nBetween the two, we like Axis Bank more. We like the direction and execution of the bank. It is back to reporting 1.8% kinds of ROAs, similar to what it was reporting back in FY12-14. However, the difference this time is the quality of its loan book and liability book has been improved significantly. Thus we are confident in the stability of these numbers. Both the bank stocks have witnessed a good run on a YTD basis; going forward we see Axis Bank having better risk-reward dynamics.\n\nAjit Kabi, research analyst at LKP Securities, likes both.\n\nIn calendar year 2023, both Axis Bank and PNB have performed well. Axis Bank and PNB have given YTD returns of 19 percent and 50 percent, respectively. As per as balance sheet growth is concerned, both banks have delivered superlative growth. Asset quality for both banks remains stable. However, the margin compression of Axis Bank remained higher than PNB given lower CDR comfort for PNB. The deposit mobilisation for both the banks will be key monitorable. Factoring lower valuation, PNB would be our preferred choice among PSU banks. Axis Bank would be one of our picks on private banks.\n\nShreyansh Shah, Research Analyst, StoxBox, has chosen Axis over PNB.\n\nAlthough PNB\u2019s asset quality has seen significant improvement, it remains weaker as compared to Axis Bank. Additionally, PNB\u2019s return ratios remain subpar to the private lender on account of an increase in the operating cost and higher credit cost incurred by the bank during FY23 and H1FY24. Our pick amongst the two banks is Axis Bank as we expect it to perform well on the NIMs front in the forthcoming quarters due to its focus on premiumisation, which it got from CITI\u2019s customers. Most of the high cost of integration with CITI Bank has been accounted for by the private lender in H1FY24 and we believe that the bank\u2019s profitability will deliver double-digit growth in the future.\n\nSonam Srivastava, Founder and Fund Manager at Wright Research, PMS, suggests choosing between PNB and Axis Bank based on individual risk appetite.\n\nDeciding between PNB and Axis Bank for long term hinges on your risk appetite. PNB, anchored by the government, boasts wider reach and potentially higher deposit rates, but its slower digital adoption and lower financial returns raise concerns. Axis Bank, with its digital edge and higher profitability, appeals to growth seekers, but its limited rural presence and higher fees require consideration.\n\nOverall, Axis Bank emerges as the favored choice among the experts, driven by its robust financial metrics and growth potential.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

            "text": "Punjab National Bank has seen its shares perform exceptionally well this year so far, rewarding its shareholders with a return of 53%. During this period, the stock has appreciated from \u20b956.80 apiece to the current level of \u20b986.40.\n\nThis marks the stock's third consecutive yearly return. In CY21, it gained 12.86%, and in the following year, it rallied another 51.34%. Currently, the stock is ranked as the top gainer in the Nifty Bank index, with a yearly return of 55.4%.\n\nAlso Read: Nifty Bank hits new record high as market surges sharply; ICICI Bank top gainer\n\nDespite this stellar performance, domestic brokerage firm Sharekhan believes the stock still has room for further growth. According to brokerage, the bank's return ratios have remained subdued compared to peers due to elevated provisions and high operational costs but are likely to improve from hereon.\n\nThe improvement in asset quality and a strong outlook are likely to help in the faster normalisation of credit costs, thereby improving the visibility for improvement in return ratios, it noted.\n\nThe bank aims for NNPL <1% and plans to run down most of the restructured book by the end of FY24E. Furthermore, a decrease in retirement-related provisions is expected to enhance cost ratios. PNB targets 12\u201314% loan growth going forward, and its CET-1 ratio, excluding H1FY24 profits, remains comfortable at 0.2%. Recently, an increase in the risk weights in unsecured loans and loans to NBFCs would have a 30\u201340 bps impact on the capital buffer.\n\nAlso Read: Indian Stock Market at record highs. Sectors and stocks experts are betting on\n\nSharekhan emphasised that the bank's excess liquidity profile (CD ratio 68%, LCR 150%) positions it well to expand the loan book without concerns about deposit growth in a challenging deposit growth environment.\n\nThe brokerage anticipates that the bank is poised to achieve higher growth as its balance sheet strength improves going forward. Strong loan growth, stable margins, and reduced operating expenses are projected to contribute to robust pre-provision operating profit (PPoP) growth, it said.\n\nAlso Read: BJP\u2019s win in heartland to keep stock market pulse beating, say analysts\n\nOverall, the brokerage maintains a stable to positive outlook on asset quality. Lower slippages formation and healthy recoveries are likely to boost asset quality further and will help in the faster normalisation of credit costs, it added.\n\nWith healthy PPoP growth and the normalisation of credit costs, the brokerage foresees an improvement in return ratios. It expects return on assets (RoA) and return on equity (RoE) to reach 0.9% and 12%, respectively, in FY25E.\n\nIn light of these factors, the brokerage continued with its 'buy' rating on the stock with a target price of \u20b9105 apiece, reflecting an upside of 22% from its current trading price.\n\nAlso Read: ICICI Bank stock hits new record high; is there more rally ahead?\n\nRobust performance in Q2FY24\n\nFor the September ending quarter, the bank reported a 20% YoY and 4.4% QoQ surge in net interest income (NII) to \u20b99,923 crore, while the net interest margin (Domestic) came in at 3.24% against 3.11% in Q2 FY23 and 3.21% in Q1 FY24.\n\nThe bank's pre-provision operating profit (PPOP) stood at \u20b96,216 in Q2FY24, registering a growth of 11.67% over the corresponding quarter of the previous year at \u20b95,567 crore.\n\nThe provisions dropped 29.8% YoY to \u20b93,444 crore. The drop in provisions and improvement in operating profit growth led the bank to record a net profit of \u20b91,756 crore in Q2 FY24, the highest in 14 quarters, with a 327% YoY improvement. During the same period last year, the bank recorded a net profit of \u20b9411 crore.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations given in this article are those of individual analysts.

            "text": "Sustaining its bullish trend for the fifth successive trading session, the Nifty PSU Bank index saw a notable 0.83% surge in today's trade (Thursday), achieving a historic peak at 5,487 points. Out of the 12 index constituents, seven closed positively.\n\nIndian Overseas Bank led the gains with a 3.4% increase, followed by Indian Bank and Punjab National Bank, recording gains of 3.1% and 1.6%, respectively.\n\nAlso Read: Nifty 50, Sensex snap 7-day winning streak; mid, smallcaps outperform; RBI MPC outcome in focus\n\nAccording to domestic brokerage firm Motilal Oswal, the recent strong performance of the BJP in state elections has instilled confidence of political stability for 2024. This positive outlook bodes well for India's macroeconomic and policy momentum, especially considering the country's leading growth among major economies in terms of both GDP and corporate earnings. This, in turn, could boost financial and banking activities going forward.\n\nShares of Punjab National Bank hit a 52-week high of \u20b987.2 apiece in today's trade. From the March 2023 low of \u20b944.1 apiece, the stock has gained 97.73% to date. With a year-to-date return of 53.76%, the stock secured the third position among the top-performing stocks in the index.\n\nAlso Read: Punjab National Bank stock gained 53% in CY23; should you buy?\n\nSimilarly, Bank of India shares also touched a new 52-week high of \u20b9118.2 apiece. This year so far, the stock has delivered a return of nearly 29%.\n\nZooming out, the Nifty PSU Bank index rallied 26.64% this year, outperforming the benchmark Nifty 50 index, which delivered a return of 15.44%.\n\nIn terms of financials, PSU banks posted another stellar performance for the September quarter (Q2FY24), reporting a net profit of \u20b933,643 crore. During the July\u2013September period of the previous fiscal, all 12 state-owned banks recorded a net profit of \u20b925,684 crore.\n\nMeanwhile, domestic equity benchmark indices - Nifty 50 and the Sensex - snapped their seven-day winning streak amid profit booking in select heavyweights.\n\nThe Nifty 50 experienced a modest dip of 0.17%, closing at 20,901 points in today's session. However, the index maintained its position above the 20,900 level for the second consecutive trading session. The S&P BSE Sensex declined by 0.19%, settling at 69,521 points.\n\nMarket experts suggest that investor attention has shifted towards the upcoming monetary policy decisions of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the US Federal Reserve.\n\n\"The market took a breather, the investors are in a wait-and-watch mode ahead of the monetary policy announcement. A better-than-estimated Q2 GDP growth, an ease in global oil prices, and a drop in global bond yield will be the silver lining for the MPC. However, the expectation of a rise in domestic November inflation, a drop in Rabi cultivation, and an increase in foodgrain prices will influence the RBI to adopt a cautious approach in the short term,\" said Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services.\n\nAlso Read: RBI Monetary Policy Meet underway: Key things to watch out for\n\nOn the technical front, Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, said, \"The Nifty remained sideways during the session, hovering within the bands of 20,850\u201320,950. Sentiment remains somewhat cautious ahead of the RBI policy meeting. The near-term trend remains sideways to weak as long as it stays below 21,000, a psychologically crucial level. A decisive breakout above 21,000 might induce a resumption of the uptrend. Until then, we anticipate weakness over the near term.\"\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations given in this article are those of individual analysts. These do not represent the views of Mint.

            "text": "PNB Q2 Results: Punjab National Bank (PNB) announced its July-September quarter results for fiscal 2023-24 (Q2FY24) on Thursday, October 26, beating D-Street estimates with a multifold growth of 327 per cent in net profit to \u20b91,756 crore, compared to \u20b9411.3 crore in the corresponding period last year.\n\nThe growth in the bank's net profit was the highest in the previous 14 quarters -- on the back of higher interest income and improved credit quality. The state-run lender's net-interest income (NIIs) \u2013 the difference between interest earned and interest expended- in the second quarter of current fiscal rose 20 per cent to \u20b99,923 crore, compared to \u20b98,270.7 crore in the year-ago period.\n\nPNB Q2 Results: Here are the key numbers\n\nAtul Kumar Goel, Managing Director (MD) and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), PNB told news agency PTI that the credit cost will reduce in the coming quarters and profitability of the bank will increase. The net interest income, net profit, and operating profit are highest in the past 14 quarters, he said.\n\n\"RAM (Retail, agri and MSME sectors) will be the focus areas of PNB. In the first half of current fiscal (Apri-September), we achieved a profitabiity of over \u20b93,000 crore. \"I am hopeful that we will be able to maintain the same profitability in the third and fourth quarters,\" Goel told reporters.\n\nThe bank's asset quality for the quarter ended September 2023 improved on a sequential basis. PNB\u2019s gross non-performing assets (NPA) during Q2FY24 decreased to \u20b965,563.12 crore compared to \u20b970,899.34 crore in the preceding April-June quarter.\n\nAlso Read: PNB Q2 Results: Net profit jumps 327% to \u20b91,756 crore; NII rises 20% YoY\n\nThe net NPA also fell to \u20b913,114.12 crore from \u20b917,129.47 crore in the June quarter of current fiscal. The Gross NPA as a proportion of gross advances decreased to 6.96 per cent in Q2FY23 from 7.73 per cent in Q1FY24. The Net NPA as a proportion of net advances declined to 1.47 per cent in the September quarter from 1.98 per cent in the June quarter.\n\nThe public-sector lender's global business increased 11.26 per cent to \u20b922,51,631 crore in the September quarter as against \u20b920,23,713 crore in the year-ago period. The bank's savings deposits increased to \u20b94,71,238 crore in Q2FY23 from \u20b94,51,707 crore, while current deposits were at \u20b967,038 crore.\n\nPNB Q2 Results: Here's how the stock is expected to open tomorrow\n\nAfter a massive surge in net profit and improved asset quality reported in the September quarter, analysts expect shares of PNB to open in the green on Friday, October 27.\n\nAfter the announcement of Q2FY24 results, PNB share price recovered from losses and traded higher in the second half of today's session. PNB stock price gained as much as 1.22 per cent to hit an intraday high of \u20b970.30 apiece on the BSE.\n\n\u2018\u2019As expected, the state-owned Punjab National Bank gave strong numbers in Q2FY24. The bank delivered a three-fold jump in net profit, beating market estimates while maintaining robust asset quality. The NPAs were down significantly on an annualised basis, and we are of the view that the bank has cleared a large part of its pain and can focus on building the business,'' said Shreyansh Shah, Research Analyst, StoxBox\n\n\u2018\u2019With the bank\u2019s focus on growing its loan disbursals in the housing segment, we believe that it will be able to generate higher yields in the medium term. Thus, we remain positive on the bank from a medium to long term perspective,'' added Shah.\n\nAfter reporting the Q2FY24 numbers earlier today, shares of PNB settled 0.52 per cent higher at \u20b969.81 apiece on the BSE.\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of individual analysts and broking companies, not of Mint.
