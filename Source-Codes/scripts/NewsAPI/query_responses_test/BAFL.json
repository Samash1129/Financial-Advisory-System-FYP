            "text": "Bank Alfalah Limited (PSX: BAFL) has received approval from its Board of Directors to establish an exchange company with an initial paid-up capital of Rs2 billion.\n\nThe bank will raise the required capital by issuing 200 million ordinary shares at a price of Rs10 per share, as revealed in a filing on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday.\n\nThis exchange company will function as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank Alfalah. However, this decision is subject to approval and clearance from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and other regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nRead This: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nThis move is part of a broader effort to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP is implementing structural reforms in the exchange company sector to strengthen oversight, governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures.\n\nThe SBP has also increased the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the added condition that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nBank Alfalah joins several major banks, including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), and Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), in their pursuit to establish their own forex companies.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "Bank Alfalah Limited, one of Pakistan\u2019s leading commercial banks, has announced an investment of Rs 1.2 billion in its brokerage subsidiary, Alfalah CLSA Securities (Private) Limited.\n\nThe brokerage house is a sort of partnership between the Abu Dhabi Group-owned Bank Alfalah and CLSA Limited, which is a brokerage house based in Thailand.\n\nThe company is currently running a pure agency brokerage house offering equity brokerage, online trading, commodities trading, research, investment banking, foreign exchange services, money market, and advisory services.\n\nWhy is there a need for such a large investment?\n\nThe recent accounts of Alfalah CLSA show that the company went from making a profit of Rs. 7 million in 2022 to a loss of Rs. 1.1 billion in 2023. The onus of the poor performance lies on the brokerage house\u2019s inability to control operating expenses. Additionally, the company utilized a short-term borrowing facility to increase its exposure margin, leading to a significant rise in finance costs.\n\nIn order to shore up the brokerage house, the bank has decided to invest a large amount. in fact, due to the loss made this year, Alfalah CLSA saw its equity turn negative. In order to shore up investor confidence and to make sure the brokerage house keeps operating, the bank was strengthening the balance sheet.\n\nThis is not the first time such an investment is being made. The bank originally owned 97.91% of the brokerage house when it was incorporated in 2003. Once the house started to perform, right shares were given out to investors which decreased the bank\u2019s shareholding. Financial years of 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 have not been good for the brokerage house as it has made a cumulative loss of Rs. 1 billion which led to the equity turning negative.\n\nBacked by big players\n\nBank Alfalah is one of the largest banks of Pakistan with a network of over 1000 branches across more than 200 cities and has an international presence in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bahrain and UAE. The bank is originally owned by Abu Dhabi Group and has been operating since 1992. The bank owns 61.2% of Alfalah CLSA Securities (Private) Limited and has 40.2% ownership of Alfalah GHP Investment Management Limited which is an asset management company of the bank.\n\nCLSA BV was a company founded in 1986 by Jim Walker and Gary Coull who were journalists by profession and are considered to be pioneers of the Asian securities industry and its development. The company has a network spanning Asia, Australia, Europe and United States and has offices in 21 locations around the world. The company is known for its investment advisory and asset management services and has been awarded for its renowned services. CLSA was overtaken by CITIC Securities in 2013. CLSA owns 24.9% of Alfalah CLSA as of today.\n\nCITIC Securities is China\u2019s leading brokerage and investment bank and largest underwriter of Chinese debt and equity. CITIC was founded in 1995 and offers brokerage services, investment banking and asset management to corporations, financial institutions, governments and individuals.\n\nThe new investment in perspective\n\nThe investment of Rs. 1.2 billion would be channeled towards purchasing and subscribing additional shares of the brokerage house at Rs. 10 per share. This investment is going to be for an indefinite period.\n\nThe resolution, as mentioned earlier, has been passed which means that an additional 120 million shares in the brokerage house will be issued and subscribed.\n\nThe brokerage house currently has 40 million issued and subscribed shares and would be increasing them to 160 million with Bank Alfalah\u2019s shareholding increasing from 62.5% to 90.6% and decreasing CLSA BV\u2019s share from 24.9% to 6.2%.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Lucky Cement Ltd has completed a second share buyback exercise representing 6.5 per cent of its paid-up capital at spot prices, the company said on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Arif Habib Ltd, the cement maker\u2019s average purchase price was Rs632.60 per share for 20.375 million shares that it bought between June 2 and Nov 20.\n\nAs a result, the share buyback cost the company a total of Rs12.9 billion, which makes it the biggest exercise of its kind conducted on the Pakistan Stock Exchange.\n\nThe company completed its first buyback round consisting of 10m shares back in March at a total cost of Rs4.35bn. The stated purpose of the buyback exercise is to cancel the shares after acquiring them using the company\u2019s distributable profits.\n\nMany listed companies have carried out share repurchase exercises in the ready market in the recent past. The total number of shares goes down once a company conducts a buyback, leading to an increase in its earnings per share as well as its break-up value \u2014 the amount that the company would be worth if it was liquidated.\n\nCompanies that have completed share buybacks in recent months include Netsol Technologies Ltd, JDW Sugar Mills Ltd, Bank Alfalah Ltd, Engro Corporation Ltd, Kohat Cement Company Ltd, Habib Bank Ltd and Kohinoor Textile Mills Ltd.\n\nSome analysts believe the reduction in the volume of tradeable shares is bad for the stock market. Others say the exercise provides investors with a higher-than-usual share price to liquidate their investments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 22nd, 2023",

            "text": "After a volatile session at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), strong corporate results helped stocks stage a final-hour rally, pushing the benchmark KSE-100 beyond 62,000 with an over 400-point gain on Thursday.\n\nDuring most part of the day, the benchmark index had remained largely range-bound.\n\nHowever, it picked up traction in the final hour of trading, and at close, the benchmark index settled at 62,393.73, an increase of 414.55 points or 0.67%.\n\nExperts said investor sentiment improved after strong corporate results especially by the index-heavy banking and energy sectors.\n\nShares of index-heavy energy stocks including OGDC and PPL closed in the green alongside scrips of Bank Alfalah and Soneri Bank, which posted significant profit growth.\n\nAt close on Wednesday, the benchmark index retreated amid late selling to close at 61,979.18, an increase of 137.44 points or 0.22%.\n\nExperts said that the market is keenly awaiting the polls, and a rally is expected post-elections.\n\n\u201cThe General Elections 2024 are expected to be held on 8th Feb\u201924, and transition of power to the newly elected government is expected to increase investor confidence in the market,\u201d said Arif Habib Limited (AHL) in a report on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWith the ongoing result season, certain scrips are expected to remain in the limelight on the expectation of robust results,\u201d it added.\n\nPRL posts PAT of over Rs2bn profit in 2QFY24\n\nGlobally, the Asian shares faltered on Thursday after Wall Street took a late spill, while investors stuck to bets for sizable cuts in US interest rates this year even if the kick-off might now be a little later than first hoped.\n\nThe Federal Reserve committee\u2019s decision to hold rates at 5.25-5.5% on Wednesday was no surprise, it took a dovish twist by emphasising that rates would not be cut until it had more confidence that inflation was truly beaten.\n\nIn a media conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell flatly stated a cut as early as March seemed unlikely, but also conceded that everyone on the committee was looking to ease this year.\n\nVolume on the all-share index decreased to 270.5 million from 276.4 million a session before.\n\nThe value of shares increased to Rs11.62 billion from Rs9.27 billion in the previous session.\n\nK-Electric Ltd was the volume leader with 34 million shares, followed by Soneri Bank Ltd with 28.1 million shares, and Pak Refinery at 26.1 million shares.\n\nShares of 346 companies were traded on Thursday, of which 166 registered an increase, 154 recorded a fall, while 26 remained unchanged.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Despite strong corporate results and better performance on the external front, the political and law and order issues continued driving investor sentiments who preferred to take profit in the outgoing week ahead of the general elections on Feb 8.\n\nThe share market opened the week on a negative note as the benchmark KSE 100-share index suffered the highest day-on-day loss of 1,040 points since Dec 26, 2023, ahead of the announcement of the monetary policy statement in the evening.\n\nOn Tuesday it extended the overnight gloomy trend and dropped by 931 points falling below the 62,000 level after PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi were handed down a 10-year jail term in a cipher case. In the last three sessions, the index resumed its recovery drive on the back of positive economic numbers.\n\nArif Habib Ltd said the stock market remained depressed due to political noise coupled with uncertainty related to circular debt resolution.\n\nAdditionally, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the benchmark policy rate unchanged at 22 per cent in the monetary policy committee meeting held on Jan 29. Furthermore, the headline inflation slightly eased to 28.3pc in January from 29.7pc in December.\n\nIn addition to this, the trade deficit for January contracted by 25pc year on year to $1.9bn. Meanwhile, the SBP\u2019s reserves dropped by $54m, reaching $8.2bn. During the week rupee closed at 279.41 against the greenback strengthing by 0.07pc week-on-week.\n\nOil sales fell 13pc in July-January FY24, petrol price was raised by Rs13.55 per litre and development funds were cut by Rs114bn.\n\nHence, the market closed at 63,003 points after declining 810 points or 1.3pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise negative contributions came from fertiliser (181 points), oil & gas marketing companies (130 points), chemical (121 points), technology and communication (86 points) and power generation & distribution (66 points).\n\nMeanwhile, the sectors which mainly contributed positively were automobile assembler (88 points), cable & electrical goods (7 points), insurance (7 points), and pharmaceuticals (3 points). Scrip-wise negative contributors were Colgate-Palmolive (Pakistan) Ltd (105 points), Mari Petroleum Ltd (94 points), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (80 points), Engro Fertilisers Ltd (77 points) and PSO (64 points). Meanwhile, scrip-wise positive contributions came from Oil and Gas Development Company (122 points), Millat Tractors Ltd (80 points), MCB Bank Ltd (78 points), Bank Alfalah Ltd (22 points) and Askari Bank Ltd (8 points).\n\nForeign selling continued during the outgoing week, clocking in at $9.7m compared to a net sell of $22.7m last week. Major selling was witnessed in commercial banks ($2.7m) and cement ($2.2m). On the local front, buying was reported by insurance companies ($7m) followed by broker proprietary trading ($1.5m). Average volume dipped by 24.7pc to 313m shares while the average value traded plunged 43.2pc to $41m week-on-week.\n\nAccording to AKD Securities Ltd, the trading next week will be overshadowed by general elections and market participation is expected to remain subdued.\n\nFollowing the successful completion of the elections, the market is anticipated to gain momentum. Furthermore, the circular debt settlement and industrial tariff rationalisation plans, if they pass through the International Monetary Fund are likely to boost investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 4th, 2024",

            "text": "Pakistan\u2019s stock market is expected to reach above 80,000 levels by the end of 2024, as the country undergoes economic reforms, monetary easing, and improved macroeconomic indicators.\n\nAccording to a research report by AKD Research, the market movement will be erratic over 2024, due to two major checkpoints which include the external funding facilities, especially the IMF program, and the general elections in early February 2024.\n\nHowever, these events will also create opportunities for investors to buy stocks at low valuations, as the market currently trades at multi-year low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios.\n\nInterest rates will decline by 500 basis points over 2024, starting from March, as the inflationary pressures ease and the money supply growth slows down. The average consumer price index (CPI) is also expected to drop from 25.3% in 2024 to 11.5% in 2025.\n\nThe lower interest rates will benefit the cyclical and leveraged sectors, such as cements, steel, and fertilizers, as well as the banking sector, which will enjoy higher net interest margins and lower provisioning costs.\n\nThe report also highlights the positive economic undercurrents led by the recent measures taken by the caretaker government, which include fiscal consolidation, exchange rate stability, and structural reforms.\n\nThe report estimates the fiscal deficit to be 7.0% of GDP in 2024, while the external funding gap of $4-5 billion will be met by the support from Saudi Arabia, China, and UAE.\n\nHowever, the uncertainty regarding the external funding situation is a risk factor, especially the status of a new IMF program, which is crucial for bridging the net funding gap of US$4-5 billion over the next 12 months.\n\nThe report recommends a bullish stance on the stock market, with a thematic focus on three factors, including the economic reform process, the monetary easing, and the undemanding valuations.\n\nThe brokerage house recommended a diversified portfolio of stocks that are expected to outperform the market in 2024, based on their fundamentals, growth potential, and valuations. The preferred sectors include banks, oil and gas, oil marketing companies, power, and cyclicals.\n\nThe top picks are Meezan Bank, United Bank, MCB, Bank Alfalah, Hub Power Company, Oil and Gas Development Company, Mari Petroleum, Pakistan State Oil, Attock Petroleum, Lucky Cement, Maple Leaf Cement, Fauji Cement, Mughal Iron and Steel Industries, Fauji Fertilizer, Engro Fertilizers, and Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim.",

            "text": "With the interest rate still at a record high and no break in sight, commercial banks in the country are continuing to make bank off the back of government-backed securities.\n\nTake Bank Alfalah as an example. In their recently released financial results for the year 2023, Bank Alfalah revealed that they had achieved growth in the bottom line of more than 96%. Based on the results, it can be seen that the bank has been able to increase its earnings per share from Rs 10.38 at the end of 2022 to Rs 23.15 in 2023.\n\nThe results showed that in 2022, the bank saw a net markup return of 36% which fell to 30% in 2023. This meant that even though markup income almost doubled, the interest expense for the company was much higher leading to a fall in the ratio.\n\nAnd it isn\u2019t just Bank Alfalah. Most commercial banks in the country can expect rich returns this year. That is because despite a myriad of economic challenges facing the country, the banking sector has thrived amidst challenging economic conditions, with remarkable earnings over the past two years, especially in the current financial year.\n\nPakistan has seen interest rates at record-high levels since the end of June 2023. The country has been fighting a losing battle with inflation, leading to the State Bank of Pakistan maintaining interest rates at unsustainable levels. One of the conditions set by the IMF also revolves around the fact that as net interest rates are negative, no cut can be expected unless inflation falls below the prevailing rates.\n\nAs a result, banks have been investing in government-backed securities which are secure and generate a high rate of return. By lending with minimal risk and earning a favorable spread between borrowing and deposit rates, banks have achieved impressive profits, as reflected in their year-end accounts. If this pattern of high interest rates continues in the upcoming year, banks may further enhance their financial performance, contingent upon the duration of rate stability.\n\nConsolidated Financial Results for the year ended December 31, 2023 (In thousands) FY 2023 FY 2022 % Change Mark-up/return/interest earned 412,005,030 214,106,020 92% Mark-up/return/interest expensed 286,053,140 136,933,108 109% Net mark-up/interest income 125,951,890 77,172,912 63% Non-mark-up/interest income Fee and commission income 15,428,789 11,231,877 37% Dividend income 1,022,878 1,091,320 -6% Foreign exchange income 9,554,818 9,218,628 4% Gain/(loss) from derivatives 1,760,669 331,578 431% Gain/(loss) on sale of securities 295,743 -65,024 \u2013 Share of profit from associates 1,690,573 669,831 152% Other income 333,846 325,971 2% Total non-mark-up/interest income 30,087,316 22,804,181 32% Total income 156,039,206 99,977,093 56% Non mark-up/interest expenses Operating expenses 64,982,495 49,897,939 30% Workers welfare fund 1,714,807 907,442 89% Other charges 279,412 27,178 928% Total non-mark-up/interest expenses 66,976,715 50,832,559 32% Profit before provisions 89,062,492 49,144,534 81% Provisions and write-offs \u2013 net 10,324,754 12,467,133 -17% Extraordinary/unusual items \u2013 \u2013 Profit before taxation 78,737,738 36,677,401 115% Taxation 42,651,377 18,279,937 133% Profit after taxation 36,086,361 18,397,464 96% Earnings per share \u2013 basic 23.15 10.38 123%\n\nWhile the results from other banks are imminent, Alfalah seems to have done quite well for itself. The company saw an increase in its fees and commission income, share of profit from associates and gain from derivatives which showed that total income jumped from Rs 100 billion to Rs 156 billion in 2023.\n\nIn terms of expenses, the bank was able to limit its operations which saw expenses increase by 30% overall. Due to the increase in income and decrease in expenses, the bank was able to earn a profit before tax which more than doubled from last year. In 2022, the company saw profit before taxation of Rs 37 billion and increased to Rs 79 billion in 2023.\n\nBut that isn\u2019t all. The government will have something to be happy about in all of this. Due to higher profitability and taxes levied on the company, its tax bill is expected to be much higher this year. Regardless of that, the company still saw its profit after taxation more than double this year.\n\nDue to the performance this year, the company announced a dividend of Rs 5 per share which was in addition to the Rs 3 which has already been given in the shape of interim dividend. This is the highest dividend that the bank has given out in its history and it can be expected that, unless rates are revised downward, these results will be replicated or even increase.\n\nThe trajectory of the results could be seen long in the past when the company was able to earn Rs 12 per share in just 6 months this year where it had only been able to earn Rs 10.38 for the whole year before that.",

            "text": "If you are a reader of Profit, you will know by now that everyone is taking the digitization of the economy very seriously. Much of the efforts for this digitization can be attributed to the adventures of technology companies \u2013 aka, the venture-funded startups. Some of them are taking small retailers online by helping them create online stores. Others are focused on digitising payments and procurement. The list goes on.\n\nAnd the regulators have noticed. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has rolled out numerous regulations to prop up fintech companies to digitise payments. Numerous directives from the central bank are focused on increasing the adoption of digital payments. And to that end, the instant payments system Raast was launched last year.\n\nThe kicker here is that banks, too, now seem to be convinced that if they don\u2019t propagate digitisation, someone else [read: startups] will, challenging the banks\u2019 status quo. If you\u2019re wondering how a tech startup, say in logistics, threatens banks, remember that payments are at the center of everything. In the words of Angela Strange of the storied venture capital firm Andreseen Horowitz, \u2018every tech company is a fintech company\u2019.\n\nOne bank has taken notice, as evidenced in the recent partnership announced in November 2023 between Bank Alfalah and Chikoo. The latter is a prominent technology company that provides an app-based digitisation to micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in Pakistan. It is now set on providing the same digitization to Bank Alflah\u2019s hardware devices.\n\nThe Chikoo app can now be downloaded on Alfalah\u2019s point-of-sale (PoS) devices, facilitating the digitisation of orders, payments, and customer management directly from the Bank Alfalah PoS device. Now, any offline retailer that records its inventory through the Chikoo app, can also immediately create an eCommerce site to sell goods online.\n\nBroadly speaking, both Bank Alfalah and Chikoo believe that digitizing small and medium scale businesses is a big opportunity: one that can bring big business and impact the entire economy.\n\n\u201cOur aim at Bank Alfalah is to help merchants be able to increase sales and business through such digitisation,\u201d says Ammar Naveed Ikhlas, head of retail payments solution at Bank Alfalah. Ikhlas is one of the key people behind this scheme.\n\nFor a bank, it can bring in more payments revenue and financing opportunities in the long run. For a company like Chikoo, any partnership that helps it achieve greater scale brings more revenue in from fees collected from using the platform.\n\nThe opportunity\n\nLogically, MSMEs is where the opportunity also exists. There are an estimated 5 million MSMEs in Pakistan that mostly have manual operations and use paper and pen to record transactions, which becomes time consuming and costly. If these operations are digitised, these businesses can become more efficient, grow their sales and make operations more profitable by making smart business decisions based on data collected through digitisation.\n\nOne aspect of such digitisation is enabling small businesses to record inventory on a digital platform so that tracking inventory becomes easier. To illustrate with an example, let\u2019s say that you are a home-based baker who sells cookies and doughnuts online. Every time you bake your products, you can record the quantity you have baked on the Chikoo platforms on either the phone or a computer so that when an order is processed, also via the Chikoo app, the quantity sold and the quantity remaining are automatically adjusted on the platform. If you use a website to sell your products, and the next time someone orders and you are out of stock, the product on the website will automatically reflect as out of stock.\n\nThis way, inventory management improves and you as a seller do not have to worry about manually recording how much you sold in a day, or getting on calls back and forth to inform customers that a certain product is no longer available.\n\nThis is just one aspect of digitisation. Others could be digitisation of invoices and payments. The main end of such digitisation is to bring the focus of a small company towards growing the business by, say improving their products instead of wasting time and money on managing inventory and invoices or collecting payments and then reconciling them.\n\nChikoo is already focused on such digitization at small retailers, but only through an app to give them inventory, sales management, payments and eCommerce functionalities. While Bank Alfalah is focused on increasing the penetration of PoS machines in the market for acceptance of digital payments. What if the two were combined? That is to make the Chikoo app available on the Bank Alfalah PoS.\n\nRather than going at it alone, it\u2019s better for both to do it together. A bank does not have either the technology capabilities or the mindset to build offerings such as inventory management and invoicing, so stands to gain if retailers have these options. Similarly, a company like Chikoo can perhaps never create its payments acceptance business, so it also will gain if it is able to accept payments through its platform.\n\nRaza Matin, chief executive officer and co-founder of Chikoo, says, \u201cOur platform is available in a multitude of ways, so customers who are not currently utilising digital payments can still use their smartphones to access Chikoo\u2019s services, while businesses with a certain volume of customers, who use digital payments or will benefit from digital payments will be eligible to get the PoS machine.\u201d\n\nWinners and losers\n\nBut is this partnership really worth its salt? Consider that solutions like this already exist in the market. For example, retailers of sizable scale use their own PoS hardware on which Shopify provides the same inventory management tools. What is so special about this partnership, and will retailers accept it?\n\nFor starters, the size and scale of the business that matters. Ikhlas explains that firstly, their target market is not the retailers that have already digitized their retail operations. Take CarreFour, for example. The hypermarket giant has customized hardwares and softwares to digitize operations as per their scale. So targeting these retailers does not make sense either for Chikoo or Bank Alfalah.\n\nOn the other hand, small businesses that need to be targeted would like to save as much as possible while carrying out such digitization. Any such digitisation will come with a hefty purchase of hardware, whether it\u2019s a computer, a barcode scanner or a handheld tablet, along with accompanying software. Pains of the economy aside, these retailers are old fashioned and have been working in a set way for decades. They haven\u2019t seen the benefits of such digitization and therefore they have less willingness to go for it. The best way to get them to digitise their operations is by giving them this digitisation at the lowest cost possible.\n\nWhich is why, Ikhlas explains, the hardware costs in the case of Bank Alfalah are not charged to these retailers.\n\n\u201cInstead, the cost of the machines are built into the transactions in the form of a fee charged every time a payment is processed on these machines,\u201d says Ikhlas. These machines are currently only used to process card payments.\n\nBut with the Chikoo app now built into these machines, retailers will now have access to Chikoo\u2019s services such as inventory management, invoice generation and payments acceptance. This will serve the larger goal of eliminating inefficiencies, enabling the collection of reliable data, and providing context for business growth.\n\nThese machines currently only accept card payments, but could do much more because of their android functionality. Bank Alfalah already has an estimated 15,000 PoS machines in the market.\n\n\u201cAll the functionalities have been embedded into Bank Alfalah PoS,\u201d says Matin. \u201cIt marries the payment experience and business management system. When you combine customer data, invoice data, and payment data, that is less paper and more information can be extracted from it, which can be used to make better business decisions and help merchants grow.\u201d\n\nSome up and coming startups such as SnappRetail and Aladdin are also focused on such digitization, but achieve it through proprietary hardware and software, charging the merchant a monthly rental fee. Chikoo\u2019s advantage is that it is not focused on such proprietary hardware.\n\nThat being said, the arrangement is not exclusive: Bank Alfalah can later potentially make SnappRetail or Aladdin\u2019s app available on their machines, leaving it to the merchant to decide which one they would like to use. Likewise, Chikoo is also free to partner with other banks and integrate its app with their PoS machines.\n\nOn the other hand, Chikoo can help drive the adoption of the bank\u2019s PoS machines and market them to merchants that currently use only the Chikoo app. But it is going to be a rough journey.\n\nMatin admits that training retailers \u2013 who are often rigid when it comes to changing their attitudes as they have been working in a set way for decades \u2013 is going to be a tough task. That is why Chikoo will have its own people on the ground, and will leverage the distribution network and sales teams at Bank Alfalah to educate merchants about the Chikoo app and its benefits.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t acquire these customers digitally,\u201d Matin says. \u201cTo get merchants to do this is going to require a lot of handholding. They have to see that they have to realise the benefits that are going to come out of this and this is going to require people on the ground.\u201d\n\nBoots on the ground has been a consistent focus of other startups as well. SnappRetail and Aladdin Informatics, for instance, have also deployed teams that acquire grocery merchants and then train them to use their hardware and software.\n\nHow will Chikoo make money from this partnership? Matin explains there are multiple revenue streams for them. Any merchant that uses the app will pay a very small recurring fee of a few hundred rupees, a small transaction fee on orders that are processed on the app, a cut from the merchant discount rate, and income from providing value added services to merchants. The app on the PoS machine will also be able to integrate offerings from other players, such as lending services from other financial institutions, to give a holistic customer experience.\n\nThis partnership is significant in one other way, explains Adeel Rasheed, co-founder at SnappRetail. Startups that are focused on such digitisation of grocery operations have been having a hard time explaining to investors that the need for such services existed. So if a tech company was able to partner with a major bank, this validates their idea and positions them better in front of relevant stakeholders.\n\nRasheed sees this as a positive for Chikoo, and refutes the idea that it would be a competition in any sense. \u201cThe market is currently too big and multiple players can exist peacefully,\u201d he said.\n\nAmer Pasha, the CEO of Aladdin Informatics also had a positive view about the partnership. \u201cThis is good news for the digitization of the economy and this will also open new avenues of partnerships.\u201d\n\nThe documentation problem\n\nThere is still one problem that might outweigh all the positives of this partnership, that neither Bank Alfalah nor Chikoo will be able to solve by themselves.\n\nSmall businesses historically have resisted becoming part of the documented economy, in an effort to avoid being taxed. Walk to a small breakfast place in your neighborhood\u2019s commercial area today and you will most likely find no option for making a payment digitally. Ask the owner and he will very likely complain that either the charges (the MDR charged by banks) are too high for a small business like them to keep a PoS machine, or that they don\u2019t even know what options they have to accept such payments.\n\nThat is to say no bank has taken the initiative to go to these businesses and present their offerings. Ask a banker and he will tell you that it is an expensive endeavor and a futile one. This is because small businesses are often not registered, and SBP regulations prevent any bank from carrying out business with unregistered businesses.\n\nIt could turn out to be very expensive for the bank to onboard unregistered merchants because of the heavy penalties imposed by regulators \u2013 in case they find out. So any mass adoption of such solutions for digitisation is going to require a consistent effort from the government to document businesses first, and then leave it to the banks to see such digitisation through. Perhaps then, this partnership will bear fruit.",
