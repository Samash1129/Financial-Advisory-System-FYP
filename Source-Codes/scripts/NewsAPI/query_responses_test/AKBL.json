            "text": "KARACHI: The equities market turned in a robust performance in the first outgoing week of the new calendar year thanks to positive developments on the economic front.\n\nArif Habib Ltd said the stock market displayed notable resilience, experiencing a significant surge of 2,211 points on Monday, recording the second-highest absolute point increase and marking the highest surge on the first working day of a new year.\n\nMoreover, positive economic indicators were evident as the Federal Board of Revenue achieved a historic one-month tax collection of Rs984bn, coupled with a substantial 40.1 per cent year-on-year reduction in the trade deficit for December 2023. However, an elevated level of headline inflation number of December at 29.7pc year-on-year raised some investor concerns.\n\nOn a positive note, the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s reserves reached $8.2bn, the highest level since July 14, 2023. Moreover, the rupee strengthened by 0.16pc against the US dollar, clocking in at Rs281.4.\n\nHence, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,515 points after gaining 2,064 points or 3.3pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise positive contributions came from oil and gas exploration companies (587 points), commercial banks (392 points), fertiliser (315 points), cement (185 points), and power generation and distribution (166 points). Sectors that contributed negatively were miscellaneous (13 points), glass & ceramics (3.2 points), investment banks (1.3 points), modarbas (one point) and leasing companies (0.1 points).\n\nScrip-wise positive contributors were Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (268 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (258 points), Fauji Fertiliser Company (151 points), Hub Power Company Ltd (120 points), and United Bank Ltd (102 points). Meanwhile, scrip-wise negative contributions came from Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans Ltd (12 points), Askari Bank Ltd (6 points), Ghani Glass Ltd (4.8 points), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (4.5 points), and BankIslami Pakistan Ltd (3.6 points).\n\nForeign selling clocked in at $3.1m compared to $1.9m in the preceding week. Major selling was witnessed in exploration and production ($1.95m) and banks ($1m).\n\nOn the local front, buying was reported by other organisations ($5.5m) and banks ($5.4m). Average daily volume arrived at 687m shares, up by 5.4pc week-on-week. The average daily value settled at $69.6m, up by 11.6pc from the preceding week.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd observed that the surge in the benchmark KSE 100-share can largely be attributed to aggressive institutional buying after the IMF announced its executive board is meeting on Jan 11 to approve $700m tranche for Pakistan.\n\nGoing forward, AKD Securities Ltd said the market is anticipated to maintain its bullish momentum, fuelled by the disbursement of the IMF second tranche. The forthcoming elections will be closely watched, and uncertainty surrounding their outcome could potentially hinder the market\u2019s bullish trend.\n\nHowever, a peaceful resolution could provide a significant boost to investor confidence. Our recommendation to investors is to maintain long-term positions in companies with strong fundamentals while tactfully managing any fundamentally weak entities through a timely profit-taking strategy.\n\nAdditionally, companies offering robust dividend yields, especially in the banking, energy, and fertiliser sectors, present opportunities for accumulation, noted AKD Securities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2024",

            "short_description": "What\u2019s up at the stock market? A rebuttal  Profit by Pakistan Today",
            "text": "On 14th December, a leading English newspaper published an opinion piece by the title \u201cWhat\u2019s up at the stock market?\u201d The fact that the write-up showed little understanding of the stock market needs no mention. But it becomes alarming when an attempt is made to understand a larger-than-life scenario in a few words. It would be like trying to write a page length summary of War and Peace expecting to get all the nuance and significance of the literary masterpiece.\n\nWhat is in the op-ed?\n\nLet\u2019s start off by trying to understand what the writer has tried to say. The writer admits outright that he rarely writes about the stock market and that he has a pessimistic view even when he does write. This already sets the expectation that he is not going to laud the market for its recent rally.\n\nThe skepticism shown here is warranted to an extent. Too many times in the past, the rally and gains in the stock market have been artificial in nature and have left retail investors holding the short end of the stick. This publication recently did a series on the three stock market crashes seen in a span of nine years at the Karachi Stock Exchange.\n\nSo it is no surprise that the op-ed\u2019s central theme is that the current rise needs to be seen with some suspicion. The rise is seen as being made up of 22,500 points which have primarily been made up of two sectors: banking and energy, where energy includes the fertiliser sector. Banks and energy have a high weightage in the KSE 100 index, and as these companies will see an increase, so will the index.\n\nIs the increase justified by the rise in earnings of these two sectors? The writer highlights the fact that out of Rs 417 billion of profits after tax seen for the first quarter, more than a third are from banks totalling Rs 149 billion, while Rs 30 billion are from oil marketing companies alone. Even based on their past results, this is a huge increase for both sectors. Banks have earned due to high interest rates, while oil marketing companies have profited from the depreciating currency and inventory gains.\n\nThe op-ed also mentions this idea of the \u2018bad broker\u2019, who is seen as being an agent of only a few clients and high net worth individuals. He is responsible for pumping the market in the direction which one or two clients want, while the broker is able to disadvantage all his remaining clientele to benefit a few. There is little economic relevance to the market turning the corner \u2013 instead, it is funded by a few brokers and their clients.\n\nWhat is not in the op-ed?\n\nThe writer leaves out some key insights from his piece which need to be mentioned.\n\nFirst, let us address the earnings question. As mentioned earlier, banks have earned due to high interest rates, while oil marketing companies have profited from the depreciating currency and inventory gains. The writer is correct in regards to the main factor behind the earnings of these two sectors \u2013 but there is a need to widen the scope of the study. The market has still seen a further rise in profits, and the writer fails to take into account the other Rs 238 billion that have been earned in after tax profits. These make up more than 57% of the remaining profits.\n\nSecondly, and more importantly, let us examine the short-term view. It is true that the market has increased from 40,000 points on June 23, 2023 to 66,500 on December 12, 2023, which is an increase of 66.3%. Out of this total increase, 45% is contributed by the banking and energy sector including the fertilizer sector. The remaining 21% has come from the remaining index constituents. Is the writer correct?\n\nNot quite. The KSE 100 index is weighted in such a manner which means that 60% of the weightage is given to the banking and energy sector while the remaining is made up by the rest of the index. This would mean that when index increases by 100 points, 60 points are expected to come from these two sectors while the remaining will come from the other companies. When things are put in that context, it can be expected that the whole index has gained and rather than just a few sectors, the whole index has seen an increase.\n\nWhat is the analysis company wise? Considering the increase seen in individual shares, 18 companies have seen an increase of more than 70% which are part of the banking and energy sector in the period analysed. An additional piece of information that is needed here is the fact that there are also 16 other index constituents which have seen an increase of more than 70% which are not part of these sectors.\n\nCompany Sector Weightage Return K-Electric Limited Energy 0.70% 176.83% Service Industries Limited Leather & Tanneries 0.65% 166.30% Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited Fertilizer 0.64% 155.70% National Refinery Limited Energy 0.41% 150.63% Pak Elektron Limited Cable & Electric 0.50% 148.46% Interloop Limited Textile 0.90% 116.68% Bank AL Habib Limited Bank 2.68% 112.70% Attock Refinery Limited Energy 0.66% 108.41% Pakistan State Oil Company Limited Energy 1.98% 107.88% Askari Bank Limited Bank 0.49% 106.27% Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited Bank 1.19% 106.25% International Steels Limited Steel 0.54% 105.62% International Industries Limited Engineering 0.43% 105.57% Thal Limited Auto 0.52% 105.26% Meezan Bank Limited Bank 3.32% 104.55% Pakistan Petroleum Limited Energy 3.79% 104.04% Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited Paper & Board 0.68% 94.51% National Bank of Pakistan Bank 0.83% 93.89% Unity Foods Limited Food & Personal Care 0.49% 91.31% Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd IT 0.41% 90.81% The Bank of Punjab Bank 0.50% 89.66% The Hub Power Company Limited Energy 5.42% 87.89% Pak-Gulf Leasing Company Limited Financial Services 0.00% 83.45% Habib Bank Limited Bank 3.38% 81.49% Cnergyico PK Limited Energy 0.46% 79.57% Bank Alfalah Limited Bank 1.67% 79.34% Kohinoor Textile Mills Limited Textile 0.23% 79.13% Yousaf Weaving Mills Limited Textile 0.01% 76.32% Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited Energy 1.02% 74.15% Pakistan International Bulk Terminal Transport 0.30% 73.57% Standard Chartered Bank (Pak) Ltd Bank 0.32% 73.10% Frieslandcampina Engro Pakistan Limited Food & Personal Care 0.33% 72.58% Pakistan Stock Exchange Limited Financial Services 0.27% 71.14% Fauji Cement Company Limited Cement 0.80% 71.08%\n\nSimilarly, once accounting for weightages, 23 companies from the banking and energy sector contributed more than 0.5% each and 13 other companies also increased by more than 0.5% each. In short, it can be seen that it is not only these two sectors which have contributed to the gain but other sectors have also contributed to the increase.\n\nCompany Sector Weightage Return Weighted Return The Hub Power Company Limited Energy 5.42% 87.89% 4.76% Pakistan Petroleum Limited Energy 3.79% 104.04% 3.94% Meezan Bank Limited Bank 3.32% 104.55% 3.47% Bank AL Habib Limited Bank 2.68% 112.70% 3.02% Habib Bank Limited Bank 3.38% 81.49% 2.75% United Bank Limited Bank 3.99% 68.02% 2.71% Oil & Gas Development Company Limited Energy 3.72% 68.20% 2.54% MCB Bank Limited Bank 3.56% 68.74% 2.45% Pakistan State Oil Company Limited Energy 1.98% 107.88% 2.14% Lucky Cement Limited Cement 3.46% 57.58% 1.99% Millat Tractors Limited Auto 2.55% 64.47% 1.64% Engro Fertilizers Limited Fertilizer 3.11% 43.33% 1.35% Bank Alfalah Limited Bank 1.67% 79.34% 1.32% Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited Bank 1.19% 106.25% 1.26% K-Electric Limited Energy 0.70% 176.83% 1.24% Mari Petroleum Company Limited Energy 2.61% 44.34% 1.16% Engro Corporation Limited Fertilizer 3.98% 27.37% 1.09% Service Industries Limited Leather & Tanneries 0.65% 166.30% 1.08% Interloop Limited Textile 0.90% 116.68% 1.05% Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited Fertilizer 0.64% 155.70% 1.00% Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited Fertilizer 3.83% 23.83% 0.91% Colgate-Palmolive (Pakistan) Limited FMCG 1.82% 49.68% 0.90% National Bank of Pakistan Bank 0.83% 93.89% 0.78% Dawood Hercules Corporation Limited Fertilizer 2.01% 38.16% 0.77% Sui Northern Gas Pipelines Limited Energy 1.02% 74.15% 0.76% Pak Elektron Limited Cable & Electric 0.50% 148.46% 0.74% Attock Refinery Limited Energy 0.66% 108.41% 0.72% Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited Paper & Board 0.68% 94.51% 0.64% National Refinery Limited Energy 0.41% 150.63% 0.62% Systems Limited IT 3.60% 16.35% 0.59% International Steels Limited Steel 0.54% 105.62% 0.57% Fauji Cement Company Limited Cement 0.80% 71.08% 0.57% D.G.

From the period of June till December, there were 48 companies which saw a return of more than 100%. Banking and energy only made up 10 of these companies while the remaining were companies that trade on the stock market but are not part of the KSE 100 index..\n\nThe writer posits that most of the index has seen a rise which is based on just two sectors. But in fact the stock market has actually seen a much wider sale increase in both index related and shares not part of the index.\n\nThis can lead to additional worries of bubbles being created, and that can be addressed with mechanisms developed by the stock exchange. However, this does not mean that the index has only increased due to movement in these two sectors.\n\nThe evil stockbroker\n\nThe second part of the op-ed deals with the notion that the evil stock brokers are able to dictate the movement of shares. These are stock brokers who are able to game the system for some of their clients, and benefit a few among them.\n\nI strongly disagree with this notion. The fact of the matter is that no broker in the market is so large that he can cause and sustain a rally of this magnitude for this long. As already shown, the movement is taking place all across the board and no broker has the resources to be able to lead to such a sustained rally by themself. Even if they are able to join forces, they still do not have the capital to be able to lead to a rally like the one seen recently.\n\nEven if it is agreed upon that clients are being disadvantaged by selling snake oil to smaller investors, how is this model sustainable? Once this rally is over, and one is able to dupe retail investors in losing their money, how will the broker sustain himself in the future?\n\nHere, let us recap what the market is and who its participants are. On the face of it, the market is made up of buyers and sellers. In order to buy from the market, there has to be someone who is willing to sell their shares.\n\nBut it is important to understand who is buying and who is selling. Pakistan is able to get investments from outside its own borders where foreigners can trade in the stock market. This is known as Foreign Investors Portfolio Investments (FIPI). Similarly, when local investors invest in the market, these are known as Local Investors Portfolio Investment (LIPI). Both these categories are made up of individuals and corporations who invest and divest their shares in the market. In terms of LIPI, trade data is also broken down for individuals, companies, banks, non-banking financial companies, mutual funds, brokers themselves, insurance companies and other organizations that might wish to invest in the stock market.\n\nThe trade data for FIPI from June 23, 2023 to December 15, 2023 shows that foreigners were net buyers of $72 million. This means that foreign investors, who have their own research to back their decision making of investment, invested in the market. Brokers can have the best manipulative powers in the world but to make a foreign investor fall for your trap would seem highly unlikely. Foreign investors have a long term view towards investment and have to justify their investment rather than say \u2018the broker asked me to invest\u2019.\n\nIn terms of LIPI, most of the buying was carried out by companies and insurance companies, while individuals and brokers sold their shares. Again, seeing only the sale would point towards shares being offloaded but the shares were bought by companies and insurance companies who have investment committee and advisory bodies who dictate how investment has to be carried out. The investment committees have to rationalize every investment decision before they follow through on it.\n\nThe need for a better understanding\n\nIt might seem like a good idea to have someone to blame and someone to target when a rally is going on in the market. After all, if an asset bubble is being created, the best course of action would be to point it out to investors beforehand.\n\nThe problem begins when an incomplete picture is used to make a judgment. Just like the tail of three blind men seeing something different rather than the elephant in the room, there is a need to take all factors into consideration before a judgment is made.\n\nThe real winners, losers and the one left \u2018holding the bag\u2019 will be revealed in due time. Even I don\u2019t feign to know the actual reasons behind this rally and am able to separate the fact from fiction. However, the op-ed feels like a knee jerk reaction on the basis of few facts, and it fails to take into account all factors relevant in this rally. This rebuttal is a small attempt to provide some reason to the recent rise.",

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

The MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 22%, citing the possibility of future easing as real interest rates are expected to stay positive for the next 12 months.\n\nThe inflation rate for January came in at 28.34%, slightly lower than AKD Research\u2019s forecast of 28.63%, but still very high compared to the regional and global averages.\n\nThe inflation was driven by the increase in energy and food prices, which offset the impact of the appreciation of the Pakistani rupee against the US dollar. The rupee ended the week at Rs 279.41 against the US dollar, up 0.07% from the previous week.\n\nThe country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves declined by $55 million to $8.22 billion, as Pakistan requested China for a $2 billion debt rollover to ease its external financing pressures.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) also lowered its GDP growth projection for Pakistan to 2% for the current fiscal year, citing the challenges of inflation and fiscal consolidation.\n\nThe Karachi interbank offered rate (Kibor) increased to 22%, reflecting the tight liquidity conditions in the banking system.\n\nAmong the sectors, exchange traded funds and transport were the top performers, gaining 5.7% and 3.2% respectively, while automobile parts & accessories, chemical and oil marketing companies were the worst performers, losing 7.4%, 6.9% and 5% respectively.\n\nThe major net sellers in the market were foreigners, who offloaded $9.7 million worth of shares, while the major net buyers were insurance companies, who purchased $7.0 million worth of shares.\n\nThe top performing companies in the KSE-100 Index were Millat Tractors, Oil and Gas Development Company, Unity Foods, MCB Bank and Askari Bank, while the top losing companies were Younus Brothers, Pakistan Tobacco Company, Colgate-Palmolive, K-Electric and Punjab Oil Mills.\n\nThe brokerage firm forecasted that the next week is uncertain, as the market will be overshadowed by the upcoming elections, which are expected to reduce the participation and activity of the investors.\n\nHowever, after the elections, the market may regain some momentum, especially if the government manages to implement the circular debt settlement plan and the industrial tariff rationalisation plan, which are pending the approval of the IMF.\n\nAKD Research maintained a bullish outlook on the banks, exploration and production, and oil marketing companies, as they offer potential for earnings growth and attractive dividend yields.",

            "short_description": "Here's What Happened in Pakistan's Banking Sector in 2023  ProPakistani",
            "text": "The banking sector in Pakistan maintained robust growth in profitability during 2023, including growth in assets and deposits, the high-interest rate regime allowed them to make handsome margins, increase investment in securities, and lend cash to the federal government at exorbitant financing rates.\n\nOn the other hand, they attracted deposits from customers, providing them with handsome returns too. There have also been major transformations and developments in a few commercial banks, which will impact the banking sector positively in the long term.\n\nALSO READ Bank Alfalah Launches Pakistan\u2019s First Digital Payments Sales and Service Centers Focusing on Merchants and Small Businesses\n\nSome of the initiatives taken by different commercial banks will be followed by other competing banks in the near future. Below are a few major developments that happened during 2023:\n\n(1) Faysal Bank\u2019s Conversion to Islamic Bank\n\nFaysal Bank announced its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank on the first day of the calendar year. The bank converted its assets, deposits, operations, branches, and licenses from conventional to Sharia-based banks and became the second-biggest Islamic bank in the banking industry.\n\nThis transition is said to be the biggest conversion of any conventional bank, not only in Pakistan but in the world, considering the size of the operation. The transformation of Faysal Bank also provided a roadmap for other banks seeking to convert their operations from conventional to Islamic.\n\n(2) MCB Bank Acquires 81% Stake in Asset Management Company\n\nMCB Bank acquired an additional 30 percent stake in its subsidiary, MCBAH Savings and Investments, at the cost of Rs. 649 million. Through this deal, the bank received 21.6 million shares, or 30 percent, of another sponsor, Arif Habib Corporation, at a share price of Rs. 30. Hence, its overall shareholding in the subsidiary increased to over 81 percent from 51 percent.\n\nMCB-AH Limited is one of the leading asset management companies in the fund management sector, and a few companies within a sector are also listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The transition in shareholding will strengthen the position of the bank in the financial sector.\n\n(3) JS Bank Acquires Major Shareholding in BankIslami\n\nJS Bank Acquired major shares in BankIslami to convert the Islamic bank into its subsidiary with ownership of the significant shareholding. The bank increased its stakes in the Islamic bank by 75 percent by purchasing shares from the parent financial entity, JS Group.\n\nThe share swap deal was successful between the sponsors of the Islamic bank, despite being challenged in the Sindh High Court. JS Bank maintained a different strategic position, which will increase its profitability and influence in the banking industry after this deal.\n\n(4) Prominent Banks Plan for Conversion to Islamic Banking\n\nProminent conventional banks with a separate division of Islamic banking announced their plans for full-fledged conversion to Islamic Banking in light of a verdict issued by the Federal Shariat Court last year.\n\nThe banks included the Bank of Punjab, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, and Summit Bank. In this regard, the Bank of Punjab hired a consultant, and Summit Bank rebranded itself as Mukramah Bank. This transition in banking operations will likely attract different conventional banks to follow the same suit.\n\nALSO READ Financial Irregularities Worth Rs.14 Billion Allegedly Uncovered During PSL Audit\n\n(5) Bank Alfalah Acquires Stakes in QistBazaar\n\nBank Alfalah acquired 7.2 percent stakes in BNPL QistBazaar at a cost of Rs. 140 million. The deal can be a win-win situation for both entities in scaling up their business and profitability.\n\nIn addition to the equity agreement, Bank Alfalah, and QistBazaar signed an embedded financing agreement in Shariah-compliant mode for up to Rs. 350 million. Accordingly, the bank will incorporate digital financing products within the QistBazaar platform to offer embedded consumer durables financing in BNPL\u2019s mode.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s move to invest in QistBazaar can prove a stepping stone to strengthening the fintech landscape of the country, as more banks are likely to follow suit for collaboration and investment in fintech companies, which is the need of the hour.\n\n(6) Major Banks to Set up Exchange Companies\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) plans to streamline the business of foreign exchange across the country with control and regulation on trade and flows of foreign currencies, mainly to monitor the stability of the rupee against the dollar. In this regard, the banking industry watched as various exchange companies in Category B shut down while commercial banks were allowed to establish their foreign exchange subsidiaries as an alternate option in the financial sector.\n\nAn overwhelming number of banks made announcements to set up subsidiaries of foreign exchange, including HBL, UBL, MCB, Bank Al Habib, Meezan Bank, Habib Metro Bank, Askari Bank, etc.\n\n(7) Summit Bank Receives Investment from UAE\n\nSummit Bank received a significant capital injection of Rs. 10 billion from its sponsor and prominent UAE investor, Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah.\n\nThe investor subscribed to 3.98 billion new shares of the bank at Rs. 2.51 per share, becoming the major shareholder in the bank. Moreover, Summit Bank plans to convert its entire operation from a conventional banking system to an Islamic one, similar to Faysal Bank. Its board of directors also approved a three-year conversion plan, and the bank has been renamed Bank Makramah Limited\n\n(8) Silk Bank Attracts Investors\n\nSilk Bank, once again, sought the financial support of a strong investor on a long-term basis to fulfill its regulatory requirements of paid-up capital and the sustainability of its profitable operations.\n\nThe bank has attracted interest from MCB Bank, United Bank Limited, International Commercial Bank of South Sudan, and Pakistan Housing Finance Company for investment and merger. At present, these financial institutions are carrying out the due diligence of the bank, which is showing the increasing competition among these entities in striking a deal with Silk Bank.\n\nSudanese Bank and Pakistan Housing Company even expressed their investment plans of 50 million euros and Rs. 12 billion, respectively. With four proposals in hand, it is a good time for Silk Bank to say yes to at least one institution with remarkable experience in local industry and operating a subsidiary.\n\nALSO READ State Bank Fails to Satisfy Panel in Rs. 70 Billion Money Laundering Scandal\n\n(9) Meezan Bank Collaborates to Launch Islamic Microfinance Services\n\nMeezan Bank took the initiative to collaborate with SAFCO Microfinance Company Private Limited (SMCL) for the launch of Islamic microfinance services in the low-income segment of society.\n\nThis is the first time that a commercial bank has significantly supported a microfinance institution. The leading Islamic bank has committed to providing Rs. 100 million in financing and technical support for product development, capacity building, and training for the microfinance company.\n\nThe step will further accelerate the penetration of Islamic banking across the country. The microfinance company established its inaugural Islamic microfinance branch under the brand name \u2018Yaqeen\u2019 in Hyderabad, Pakistan.\n\n(10) HBL to Set Up a Specialized Agri Subsidiary\n\nHabib Bank Limited received approval from the State Bank of Pakistan to set up a specialized subsidiary for the agriculture sector. The subsidiary will work to provide financial access to farmers and other players in the agriculture sector, particularly, but the institution has plans to be deeply involved in the sector\u2019s development.\n\nThe leading bank previously carried out different projects successfully in this sector, which gave it the confidence to enhance its footprints in the food sector with a much bigger role and a long-term profitable engagement. The out-of-box approach of the bank\u2019s leadership might give it a competitive edge in the industry.",
