            "short_description": "Pakistani banks log best Q4 stock returns in Asia-Pacific amid record rally  S&P Global",
            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Share prices fell sharply in the second half of Friday\u2019s trading session on the stock market amid selling pressure emanating from uncertainty on monetary policy stance and the government\u2019s plans to reduce circular debt and industrial power tariff, as a result the benchmark KSE 100 index settled below 64,000 level.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said stocks fell on pre-poll uncertainty and investor concerns for unresolved power sector circular debt, which rose to Rs2.55 trillion in the first half of FY24.\n\nHe said the uncertainty over IMF approval on the SIFC directive for the Rs1.27tr circular debt settlement plan and weak industrial earnings outlook amid surging gas tariff played a catalyst role in the bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the benchmark index opened on a positive note posting an intraday high of 236 points, but pressure was observed in the second half on account of profit-taking by investors in banks ahead of the monetary policy committee meeting due on Monday.\n\nOil and Gas Development Company Ltd, HabibMetro Bank, Indus Motor, Allied Bank Ltd and Lucky Core Industries cumulatively added 154 points to the index. On the flip side, Mari Petroleum, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank, Habib Bank and Bank Alhabib Ltd lost value to weigh down on the index by 226 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 63,813.06 points after shedding 484.94 points or 0.75 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume further dipped by 10.39pc to 412.82 million shares. The traded value also plunged by 35.89pc to Rs16.18bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan International Airline Corporation Ltd (66.17m shares), K-Electric (47.10m shares), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (31.07m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (20.13m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (18.82m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Atlas Honda Ltd (Rs28.52), Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs25.42), JS Global Capital Ltd (Rs11.64), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs11.45) and JDW Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs10.00).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs400.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs82.29), Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs44.89), Siemens Pakistan Ltd (Rs32.01) and Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs25.00).\n\nForeign investors indulged in aggressive selling as they disposed of shares worth $10.05m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 27th, 2024",

            "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) recorded gains of just 0.4% in the outgoing week as investors awaited the International Monetary Fund (IMF) review and monetary policy announcement next week.\n\nInvestors\u2019 interest was driven by encouraging corporate results, which triggered activity in specific stocks while some results did not meet market expectations, leading to selling pressure.\n\nContinuously depreciating rupee and a significant fall in the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) foreign currency reserves piled pressure on the bourse, which restricted the market\u2019s rapid advance.\n\nAt the beginning of the week, the PSX commenced trading on a robust note as it crossed the psychological barrier of 51,000 points owing to investor confidence aided by easing political uncertainties and positive economic data projections.\n\nHowever, the market lost momentum on Tuesday in a volatile session owing to selling pressure arising from geopolitical tensions and anxiety about the IMF\u2019s review under the $3 billion standby arrangement. On Wednesday, the bourse recovered, driven by earnings announcements and optimism about the IMF review, which would lead to the release of second loan tranche of $700 million.\n\nOn Thursday, the KSE-100 index ended nearly flat in range-bound trading as investors\u2019 spirit weakened over depreciation of Pakistani rupee and the decline in foreign currency reserves.\n\nOn the last day of the trading week, the index suffered losses as bears took the driving seat ahead of the monetary policy announcement and due to the looming uncertainty surrounding talks with the IMF.\n\nThe market closed at 50,944, up 212 points, or 0.42% week-on-week (WoW). In his market review, JS Global analyst Muhammad Waqas Ghani wrote that the KSE-100 index closed the week at 50,944, gaining 0.4% WoW. However, average volumes dropped 10% WoW to 366 million shares.\n\n\u201cAbove-expected earnings/ dividends announcement by Bank AL Habib, Fauji Cement, MCB Bank and Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans triggered activity in these stocks,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other hand, below-expected earnings and dividend announcement by Fauji Fertiliser Company impacted investors\u2019 sentiment and led to a 3.3% WoW decline in the stock\u2019s price. During the week, the auto assemblers announced 2-3% reduction in car prices to account for the recent appreciation of the rupee.\n\nOn the political front, the PML-N supremo returned to Pakistan who cited reduction in government expenditures, increase in tax revenue, rise in exports, IT sector reforms and improving relations with neighbouring countries as top issues on his party\u2019s agenda.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, as the IMF review was approaching fast, the government became more aggressive in pursuing its economic targets and implementing policy measures.\n\nOn a similar note, the ECC approved the much-awaited increase in gas prices while the budget deficit contracted to 0.9% of GDP in 1QFY24 from 1% of GDP during the same period of last year.\n\nPakistan also surpassed its primary surplus criterion set by the IMF, which was reported at 0.4% of GDP for 1QFY24, the JS analyst added. Arif Habib Limited (AHL) commented that the market kicked off trading on a positive note, driven by the approval of gas tariff hike, a significant step towards meeting one of the prerequisites for the IMF\u2019s review scheduled to commence on November 2, 2023.\n\nNotably, the current account deficit was recorded at $8 million for September 2023, down 95% month-on-month. \u201cThe momentum was further bolstered by the results season, which contributed to the positive trajectory,\u201d it said.\n\nHowever, the consistent appreciation of the rupee ended, resulting in the currency closing at Rs280.57 against the greenback, depreciating by Rs1.77, or 0.64% WoW. Moreover, SBP\u2019s reserves decreased $220 million to $7.5 billion, AHL said.\n\nForeigners turned net sellers as they sold stocks worth $3.47 million compared to net buying of $2.32 million last week, AHL added.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, October 29th, 2023.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",

            "text": "KARACHI: After rallying for three consecutive sessions, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday faltered amid uncertainty about whether the International Monetary Fund would give its go-ahead to the government\u2019s plans for reducing industrial power tariff and energy sector circular debt.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said unconfirmed reports of a row over the proposed circular debt management plan dampened investor sentiments.\n\nHowever, the caretaker prime minister on Wednesday directed the energy ministry to formulate an effective and durable strategy to do away with the circular debt.\n\nThe slashing of cut-off yields by up to 62 basis points for different T-bill tenors kept the banking sector under pressure.\n\nFurthermore, weak auto sector earnings and uncertainty about SBP\u2019s monetary policy direction amid high inflation also played a role in the bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said a selling spree was witnessed in energy stocks, especially in Oil and Gas Development Com\u00adpany (OGDCL) and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL).\n\nCollectively OGDCL, PPL, Bank Alhabib, Hub Power and PSO negatively contributed 510 points to the index. On the flip side, Engro Corporation, Mee\u00adzan Bank and Engro Ferti\u00adlisers added 137 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,298.01 points after losing 524.43 points or 0.81 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume dipped 4.01pc to 460.69 million shares. The traded value, however, rose 12.20pc to Rs25.24bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (49.67m shares), K-Electric (48.97m shares), Hascol Petroleum Ltd (38.80m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (27.37m shares) and Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Ltd (24.11m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs57.00), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs55.43), Al-Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs37.45), Faisal Spinning Mills Ltd (Rs17.17) and Bata Pakistan Ltd (Rs15.24).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd(Rs199.98), Philip Morris (Pakistan) Ltd (Rs53.88), Archroma Pakistan Ltd (Rs22.98), Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs16.76) and Oil and Gas Development Company (Rs9.42).\n\nForeign investors continued offloading their positions as they disposed of shares worth $6.06m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 26th, 2024",
