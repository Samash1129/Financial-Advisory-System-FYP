The stock continued to move in a range after hitting a high of Rs 1,793 in November 2021. It consolidated in a 500-point range where 1,800 acted as a stiff resistance and on the downside levels above 1300 acted as a support.",

It shall be marketed as a premium and smooth beverage for social occasions and is crafted by seasoned brewers utilising only natural ingredients, including Heineken\u2019s renowned unique A-yeast and 100% malt,\" Nuvama Equities noted.\n\nThe brokerage maintained a \u2018Buy\u2019 rating on United Breweries with a target price of \u20b91,935 per share, implying an upside of 20% from Tuesday\u2019s closing price.\n\nThe brokerage house remained positive on the Kingfisher beer manufacturer for a slew of factors that it believes will aid the company\u2019s growth.\n\nAnalysts at Nuvama believe the appointment of new MD & CEO Vivek Gupta uncorks a renewed steady push.\n\nThe brokerage is of the view that the worst of gross margins is behind given that the company has almost utilised its high-priced inventory in Q2FY24. This along with a correction in barley on a year-on-year (YoY) basis would help the company improve gross margins.\n\nMoreover, in the past one year, a few state governments have rationalised policies for beer makers, reduced taxes and revised tax rates favourably (vis-\u00e0-vis spirits). Recently, representatives of the beer industry approached the Maharashtra government, seeking a reduction in excise duty on beer, which is currently under review.\n\nAlso Read: Buy or sell: Vaishali Parekh recommends three stocks to buy today \u2014 November 29\n\n\u201cMaharashtra is a meaningful state in terms of beer consumption; if it rationalises tax policies, it will be a big boost for the industry,\" said Nuvama Institutional Equities in a report.\n\nAdditionally, glass prices have been under inflation for the past few years and have been affecting the margins of alco-beverage players. Nuvama Equities expects glass costs to rationalise Q4 onwards.\n\nLastly, it believes the beer market is poised to experience a significant increase in volume in the near future as a result of the resolution of one-off issues, favourable policies by a few state governments and the increasing acceptance of beverages with reduced alcoholic content in India.\n\nUnited Breweries share price has gained just 6% in the past three months, while the stock has fallen 4.5% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nAt 9:35 am, United Breweries shares were trading 0.48% higher at \u20b91,618.00 apiece on the BSE.\n\nCatch Live Market Updates here\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations made above are those of individual analysts or broking companies, and not of Mint.

            "text": "Investors can buy low cost index fund if they want to receive the average market return. But across the board there are plenty of stocks that underperform the market. That's what has happened with the United Breweries Limited ( ) share price. It's up 48% over three years, but that is below the market return. Zooming in, the stock is actually down 4.0% in the last year.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nUnited Breweries was able to grow its EPS at 88% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 14% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. Of course, with a P/E ratio of 169.40, the market remains optimistic.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nIt is of course excellent to see how United Breweries has grown profits over the years, but the future is more important for shareholders. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free .\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nUnited Breweries shareholders are down 3.6% for the year (even including dividends), but the market itself is up 15%. However, keep in mind that even the best stocks will sometimes underperform the market over a twelve month period. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 6%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand United Breweries better, we need to consider many other factors. For instance, we've identified that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on Indian exchanges.\n\nValuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

            "text": "Investors may contemplate selling shares of United Breweries Ltd (UBL), a major player in the beer industry and part of the global giant HEINEKEN Company, due to unsustainable premium valuations and ambitious consensus earnings expectations.\n\nDespite the so-called under-penetration of alcoholic beer in the country, we believe that beer remains a beverage with moderate growth potential. Annual sales volume (340 million cases) and consumption (around 2.1 billion litres) have not kept pace with overall economic growth in recent years, with some consumers shifting their preferences towards wine and spirits innovations.\n\nWith the stock underperforming peer companies in the alcoholic beverage sector, such as United Spirits and Radico Khaitan, over 1- and 5-year periods and the company lacking a strong historical earnings growth, UBL\u2019s valuation has become relatively expensive, standing at 126 times PE and 62 times EV/EBITDA based on FY23 figures. This represents a substantial premium compared to United Spirits, trading at 47 times PE and 51 times EV/EBITDA, or Radico Khaitan, with 72 times PE and 47 times EV/EBITDA multiples.\n\nGlobally also, UBL trades at a significant premium to peers like Ab InBev, Asahi, Kirin, and Carlsberg (14-19 times PE). Consequently, the likelihood of a downside outweighs the upside potential in UBL stock at the current price, making the risk-reward ratio unfavourable.\n\nIndustry and UBL\n\nBeer, one of the world\u2019s oldest beverages, faces stringent regulation in the Indian market with high taxation. Pricing of alcohol is firmly controlled by individual States. Despite these challenges, beer accounts for a significant portion of total alcohol consumption in India, with offerings categorised into strong and mild variants. Key States (by beer sales volume) are Telangana, Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh.\n\nOver recent years, numerous breweries have entered the beer market, expanding their product ranges to include craft beers. The primary raw materials for beer production are barley-malt, rice, hops, sugar, carbon dioxide, glass (for bottles), and packaging materials.\n\nUnited Breweries has maintained its position as the largest beer manufacturer in India, with over 50 per cent market share. The company is engaged in the production and marketing of packaged drinking water, soda, beer, and non-alcoholic beverages, boasting well-known brands such as Kingfisher, Kalyani Black Label, Sandpiper, Heineken and more. UBL has 32 manufacturing units in India.\n\nDespite beer gaining popularity in India due to its lower alcohol content and increasing acceptance in social settings, UBL\u2019s historical earnings do not present an optimistic picture. Over the last decade (FY2014-2023), UBL on a consolidated basis achieved total revenues of \u20b994,350 crore, but the company posted a net loss of approximately \u20b91,600 crore during this period. While profits have improved in the last five years ( \u20b93,700 crore), the average 14-15 per cent operating profit and around 8 percent net profit margin indicate the scope for improvements..\n\nBack to the future\n\nWith the Indian beer market being significantly underdeveloped, a promising and potential-rich future for the industry has been cited. UBL\u2019s status as major listed beer stock has contributed to its prominence and premium valuation. Future growth expectations serve as an attraction to keep investors engaged. Consequently, consensus estimates as per Bloomberg project a highly optimistic 50 per cent year-on-year adjusted earnings per share growth for UBL in both FY24 and FY25, despite sales anticipated to rise by only 8-12 per cent annually. Among frontline consumer stocks, UBL has already seen one of the sharpest downward EPS growth revisions (down 24.5 per cent) in last six months. More cuts could come as the street\u2019s expectations meet reality.\n\nAchieving these lofty projections, supported by a turnaround in margin performance, may be challenging, considering UBL\u2019s historical single-digit topline compounded annual growth rate and modest bottom-line compounded annual growth rate (in the early to mid-teens) over 3- and 5-year periods.\n\nConcerns arise from the lack of momentum in UBL\u2019s quarterly beer volume growth (year-on-year) over the last 4-5 quarters, with a negative trend in Q1FY24 (a key summer season quarter), partly attributed to supply-chain constraints and subdued performance in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Delhi, and Haryana.\n\nTo meet the ambitious EPS growth estimates for FY24 and FY25, there would need to be a significant increase in beer consumption and a substantial reduction in raw material prices. Although beer is viewed as a low-alcohol beverage, it has struggled to keep pace with changing consumer preferences.\n\nFurthermore, while Covid-induced premiumisation trends are observed in beer, increasing salience and changing price-mix is not a quick process in price-sensitive consumers of low-alcoholic beverages.\n\nDecoding the fizz\n\nAdditionally, high/complicated taxation and licensing regimes, frequent route-to-market changes, and a tricky distribution set-up can lead to volatile earnings for companies like UBL.\n\nFor instance, Indian alcohol regulations historically treated all beverages uniformly, taxing beer (5\u20136 per cent alcohol) at the same rate as higher-alcohol spirits. Alcohol is governed by State excise policies, creating a complex, State-specific tax and licensing system.\n\nSecondly, changes to route-to-market (RTM) strategy, including navigating distribution and State alcohol regulations such as excise policy, are critical. Such changes affected UBL markets such as TN, AP and Delhi in Q1FY24. In TN, RTM change impact would show up in November-December, while the same is baked in case of Delhi.\n\nThere is excessive optimism regarding supportive laws from some State governments, the recent appointment of a new MD & CEO, and buzzwords like \u2018under-penetration\u2019 and \u2018promising outlook.\u2019\n\nWhy book profit Risk-reward equation unfavourable at current levels Premium valuation based on lofty earnings expectations Lack of momentum in beer volume growth\n\nDespite being debt-free and net-cash positive, UBL\u2019s low dividend yield (0.5 per cent) is uninspiring.\n\nConsidering these factors, investors may consider selling UBL shares for now and await better entry points.\n\nRisks to our stance include sustained positive earnings surprises and unexpected softening of input prices, which could support the valuation premium.",

            "text": "It is hard to get excited after looking at United Breweries' (NSE:UBL) recent performance, when its stock has declined 3.5% over the past month. We decided to study the company's financials to determine if the downtrend will continue as the long-term performance of a company usually dictates market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nROE can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) \u00f7 Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for United Breweries is:\n\n8.4% = \u20b93.4b \u00f7 \u20b940b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. That means that for every \u20b91 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated \u20b90.08 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of United Breweries' Earnings Growth And 8.4% ROE\n\nIt is quite clear that United Breweries' ROE is rather low. Not just that, even compared to the industry average of 15%, the company's ROE is entirely unremarkable. For this reason, United Breweries' five year net income decline of 3.5% is not surprising given its lower ROE. We believe that there also might be other aspects that are negatively influencing the company's earnings prospects. For example, the business has allocated capital poorly, or that the company has a very high payout ratio.\n\nSo, as a next step, we compared United Breweries' performance against the industry and were disappointed to discover that while the company has been shrinking its earnings, the industry has been growing its earnings at a rate of 30% over the last few years.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. If you're wondering about United Breweries''s valuation, check out , as compared to its industry.\n\nIs United Breweries Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nUnited Breweries' declining earnings is not surprising given how the company is spending most of its profits in paying dividends, judging by its three-year median payout ratio of 65% (or a retention ratio of 35%). With only a little being reinvested into the business, earnings growth would obviously be low or non-existent.\n\nIn addition, United Breweries has been paying dividends over a period of at least ten years suggesting that keeping up dividend payments is way more important to the management even if it comes at the cost of business growth. Upon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to drop to 51% over the next three years. Accordingly, the expected drop in the payout ratio explains the expected increase in the company's ROE to 17%, over the same period.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, United Breweries' performance is quite a big let-down. Because the company is not reinvesting much into the business, and given the low ROE, it's not surprising to see the lack or absence of growth in its earnings. Having said that, looking at current analyst estimates, we found that the company's earnings growth rate is expected to see a huge improvement. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?\n\nValuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

After the company's third quarter results, the research team did a fundamental analysis of the company, highlighting the bullish and bearish factors.\n\nAfter United Brewery's December quarter results, brokerages such as JP Morgan and Citi also gave their calls on the stock of the company.\n\nBefore we move ahead to go through the research team's findings and brokerage calls, let's go through the performance of the company in its December quarter result.\n\nUnited Breweries Q3 results\n\nIn its standalone Year-on-Year (YoY) results, United Breweries failed to beat analyst estimates on important parameters such as profit after tax (PAT), EBIDTA and margin.\n\nThe company made a loss of Rs 2 crore in its third quarter.\n\nIt was down from a PAT of Rs 85 crore in the third quarter last fiscal.\n\nThe loss of Rs 2 crore was way below the research estimates of Rs 124 crore.\n\nUnited Breweries' revenue from operations for the December quarter improved by 13.1 per cent to Rs 1823 crore compared to Rs 1611 crore YoY.\n\nIt was slightly above research estimates of Rs 1814 crore.\n\nThe company's EBIDTA soared by 89.60 per cent to Rs 146 crore in the December quarter against Rs 77 crore in the corresponding period last year.\n\nIt was quite lower than analyst estimates of Rs 213 crore.\n\nMargin improved to 8 per cent in the quarter under review against 4.7 per cent in the year-ago period, below Street estimates of 11.7 per cent.\n\nWhile there was 8 per cent growth YoY in total volume, the premium segment volume grew by 14 per cent (YoY).Gross margins also saw an increase of 215 bps.\n\nAfter the results, let's see what the research team says about the potential of the company.\n\nUnited Breweries: Bull points\n\nThe research team says that the management of United Breweries is positive on the top line, and that high single-digit volume growth is possible.\n\nAnother positive aspect of the company is that UBL is the market leader in the beer industry, with a market share of 50 per cent.\n\nThe company has registered volume growth of 10 per cent, 9 per cent and 22 per cent in India's South, West, and East regions, respectively.\n\nUnited Breweries: Bear points\n\nIn the third quarter results, margins were lower than expected, and the company's management has no further outlook on margins (pre-COVID-19 below).\n\nNo positive impact is expected on realisation from increasing taxes.\n\nUnited Breweries' volume growth declined by 1 per cent (YoY) from Delhi and Haryana (North).\n\nApart from that, the company is also facing supply problems in Karnataka.\n\nWhat JP Morgan and Citi say about United Breweries\n\nJP Morgan on United Breweries\n\nAfter the third quarter results, JP Morgan has maintained an 'overweight' rating, cutting the target to Rs 1950 from Rs 2075.\n\nIn its report, JP Morgan says that while UBL management was positive on top-line momentum during its earnings call, it refrained from providing specific guidance on the margin outlook.\n\nThe company targets mid- to high-single digit volume growth, factoring in potential supply disruptions/adverse taxes (in select states), even as underlying demand trends in most states stay robust.\n\nThe January demand is tracking as per expectations.\n\nIt expects 7-8 per cent lower EBITDA for FY24-26 on the back of moderation in margin forecasts.\n\nCiti on United Breweries\n\nCiti has maintained its 'sell' call on the company's share, but raised the target to Rs 1600 from Rs 1500.",

            "text": "Select stocks including DCB Bank, United Breweries, Suprajit Engineering, Pitti Engineering, Arvind Fashions, ADF Foods and L&T Finance Holdings have seen fresh interest from the various domestic brokerage firms, who have recently initiated their coverage on these companies.\n\n\n\nThe host of brokerages including Keynote Capitals, Nuvama Institutional Equities, LKP Securities, Phillip Capital, Systematix Institutional Equities and Anand Rathi Research have launched their maiden reports on these stocks. Majority of these stocks have 'buy' ratings on them with an upside potential of up to 102 per cent. Here's why these analysts are positive on them:\n\n\n\nNuvama Institutional Equities on L&T Finance Holdings\n\nRating: Buy | Target Price: Rs 160 | Upside: 19%\n\nL&T Finance Holdings (LTFH) aims to become a full-fledged retail NBFC by FY25. Retail\u2019s share shall move up from 88 per cent in September 23 to 100 per cent by March 2025. Meanwhile, CEO-designate Mr Sudipta Roy, an ex-ICICI Bank retail veteran, is gearing up to beef up risk assessment and tug technological levers, said Nuvama in its maiden report on the stock.\n\n\n\nGiven its leadership in many retail segments, creditable management and successful rundown of wholesale loans a full three years ahead of schedule, LTFH is a compelling story set to turn in an RoA of 2.5 per cent by FY25E. This shall trigger the stock\u2019s re-rating. Initiating LTFH at \u2018BUY\u2019 with a target price of Rs 160, valuing it at 1.6 times BV FY25E, it added.\n\n\n\nAnand Rathi Research on ADF Foods\n\nRating: Buy | Target Price: Rs 300 | Upside: 25%\n\nADF Foods is a market leader in the prepared ethnic food segment with products spread across a wide range of categories from ready-to-eat to frozen foods and meal accompaniments. They have 8 brands catering to wider preferences of consumers. Its revenue and EBITDA increased by 18 per cent and 29 per cent CAGR from FY19 to FY23 on account of healthy product mix, operational efficiency and brand visibility, said Anand Rathi\n\n\n\n\"Healthy volume growth and margin expansion enabled them to be debt free in FY23 The rise in urban culture and fast-paced lifestyles has given a boost to processed foods. ADF Foods, with its strong portfolio, established distribution network backed by preferred brands are well placed to report profitability,\" it added while initiating coverage with a 'buy' rating and a target price of Rs 300.\n\n\n\nSystematix Institutional Equities on Arvind Fashion\n\nRating: Buy | Target Price: Rs 515 | Upside: 41%\n\nArvind Fashion is a leading player in the lifestyle space, with a strong portfolio of fashion brands across categories and price points like US Polo Association, Arrow, Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Flying Machine and Sephora. Its steadfast focus on achieving only profitable revenue growth may cause it to grow a tad slower than peers in the near-term, said Systematix in its maiden report.\n\n\n\n\"We expect the company to retain its top position among peers in terms of cash generation and EBITDA and PAT growth. Continued product innovation and increased marketing spends have helped the company in re-energizing and premiumizing its key brands. We have built in revenue, EBITDA and PAT CAGR of 12 per cent, 24 per cent and 96 per cent, respectively over FY23-25E, with 21.6 per cent RoCE for FY25E. We initiate coverage with a 'buy' rating and a target price of Rs 515,\" it said.\n\n\n\nPhillip Capital on Pitti Engineering\n\nRating: Buy | Target Price: Rs 940 | Upside: 37%\n\nFounded in 1983, Pitti Engineering is one of the leading manufacturers and exporters of electrical laminations from India and one of the leading suppliers to all motor manufacturers domestically.

Over FY18-23, revenue, EBITDA and PAT CAGR was 24 per cent, 23 per cent and 39 per cent. Citing strong industry tailwinds, capacity expansion and moving up in the value chain to improve profitability,\" it initiated coverage with 'buy' and target price of Rs 940.\n\n\n\nLKP Securities on Suprajit Engineering\n\nRating: Buy | Target Price: Rs 488 | Upside: 27%\n\nSuprajit Engineering is the market leader in domestic automotive cables, a leading player in global automotive and non-automotive cable space. The company has grown leaps and bounds through its organic and inorganic growth over the past years. It maintains a strong free cash flow generating model with nominal capex requirements along with a minimal net debt balance sheet, said LKP with a buy rating and a target price of Rs 488 on the stock.\n\n\n\n\"We are positive on SEL due to the positivity in the underlying domestic automobile industry, where SEL is a dominant player; synergies with LDC to help add new clients and products to its portfolio; new products to help drive content per vehicle; recovery in non-auto business and product portfolio expansion; the advantages of scale and India-based production,\" it said.\n\n\n\nNuvama Institutional Equities on United Breweries\n\nRating: Buy | Target Price: Rs 1,935 | Upside: 23%\n\nBeer is among the most consumed alcoholic drinks in India, and United Breweries (UBL) dominates this market. Driving beer\u2019s vogue is lower alcohol concentration, allowing it to garner favour as a healthier fill among stronger spirits, not to mention its rising acceptance in social settings. Supportive laws from a few state governments buttress its standing, said Nuvama.\n\n\n\nIndia\u2019s annual per capita beer consumption lags at a lowly 4.8 litres while the world gulps 32.5 litres on average. The appointment of new MD & CEO Mr Vivek Gupta uncorks a renewed steady push, it added while initiating coverage on the stock with a 'buy' rating and a target price of Rs 1,935.

The Bank has achieved impressive growth, with a 19 per cent CAGR in its loan book and 20 per cent CAGR in Net Interest Income (NII), said Keynote Capital. It expects a reduction in the cost-to-income ratio and an improvement in asset quality.\n\n\n\n\"It underwent a strategic transformation, focusing on retail banking and shifting toward small ticket size loans and secured loans, particularly in Tier II-VI cities. DCB has also enhanced granularity on both the assets and liabilities front by reducing concentration risk. In FY23, it demonstrated robust performance, and we expect that momentum will sustain,\" it added with a buy tag and a target price of Rs 250.\n\n\n\n\n\nDisclaimer: Business Today provides stock market news for informational purposes only and should not be construed as investment advice.

            "text": "In conversation with Zee Business, the market expert, Siddharth Sedani has recommended four stocks with a perspective of one-year under the special theme 'Urban Fabs'. Sedani has high hopes for UBL, Metro Brands, Park Hotels, and Dreamfolks and recommends investors buy these stocks with his targets. Sedani says rapid urbanisation in India is creating a golden opportunity for companies operating in cities to deliver exceptional growth. He suggests investors focus on companies transitioning from small cap to mid cap.\n\nAccording to Sedani, in India, the urban population is expected to surge from 37 per cent to 50 per cent in the next 15 years.
