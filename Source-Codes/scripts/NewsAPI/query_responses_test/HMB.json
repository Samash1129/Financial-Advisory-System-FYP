            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nBOK\u2019s initiative is a crucial component of a wider campaign by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) aimed at curbing illicit activities within the underground market.\n\nThe SBP has recently introduced structural reforms within the exchange company sector to enhance regulatory oversight, bolster governance frameworks, fortify internal controls, and tighten compliance protocols.\n\nFurthermore, the SBP has raised the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional stipulation that the capital must be unencumbered by prior losses.\n\nEarlier, major banks including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), Bank Alfalah (BAFL), Habib Metropolitan Bank, Askari Bank Limited and Bank of Punjab announced their plans to establish their own forex companies.\n\nThe SBP issued no-objection certificate (NOC) to ABL and MCB for establishing their exchange companies. Allied Bank\u2019s exchange company will be named ABL Exchange Company (Private) Limited and MCB\u2019s as MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

They truly are leaders in all respects in Pakistan\u2019s corporate sector.\n\nThe PSX Top 25 Companies Awards recognize companies achieving certain key pre-requisites for this prestigious award, which include having a minimum dividend distribution of 30 percent and shares of the company having been traded at least 75 percent of the total trading days in a year, among other pre-requisites.\n\nSubject to achieving these pre-requisites, the companies are further weighed based on certain quantitative and qualitative criteria.

He is confident that this will send a strong message to investors locally as well as globally that Pakistan\u2019s economy does indeed consist of companies that not only outshine others locally but are comparable to the best companies internationally as well.\n\nThese companies deserve even more credit this year, as does the corporate sector overall, since they have performed exceptionally well in a difficult and challenging economic environment, he added. As in previous years, PSX plans to host an event to celebrate and commemorate these companies.\n\nThe companies that made it to the Top 25 Companies Awards list in 2022, in order of their ranking includes Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited, Engro Corporation Limited, Systems Limited, Engro Fertilizers Limited, Engro Powergen Qadirpur Limited, Engro Polymer & Chemicals Limited, Security Papers Limited, Habib Bank Limited,Pakistan Oilfields Limited, Bank Alfalah Limited, Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited, Millat Tractors Limited, Mari Petroleum Company Limited, Cherat Cement Company Limited, United Bank Limited, Archroma Pakistan Limited, International Industries Limited, MCB Bank Limited, Lotte Chemical Pakistan Limited, Indus Motor Company Limited, Jubilee Life Insurance Company Limited, Pakistan Cables Limited, The Hub Power Company Limited, Cherat Packaging Limited, Pakistan State Oil Company Limited.",

            "short_description": "Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve and what it doesn't  Profit by Pakistan Today",
            "text": "In early September, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) made a decisive move, signalling that it had had enough. It unfurled a sweeping set of reforms targeting exchange companies. These reforms were not just about tightening the reins on the open market; they were a strategic endeavour to bolster governance, enhance internal controls, and elevate compliance standards to new heights.\n\nThe SBP\u2019s actions were fueled by apprehensions that exchange companies were failing to provide foreign currency to customers when it was available while also carrying out off-the-books transactions, resulting in substantial disparities between interbank rates and those offered by these companies.\n\nUnder the umbrella of these structural reforms, the SBP has given exchange companies three months to increase their paid-up capital and consolidate into a single category. It has also \u201cencouraged\u201d top banks to open exchange companies (more on that later).\n\nThe burning question is: What does this mean for the currency markets \u2014 is the central bank simply trying to rein in illegal activity and increase oversight of the open market, or does it plan to eventually phase out the open market completely?\n\nBefore the reforms\n\nThere are two legal currency markets in Pakistan: the interbank market which is made for and participated in by banks, and the open market which comprises exchange companies. According to the Standby Agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in June, the difference in the rates cannot exceed 1.25% for more than five consecutive days.\n\nThis is because the central bank intervened in the interbank market in the past, including last year, to control the rupee\u2019s depreciation by imposing an artificial cap on the dollar to rupee exchange rate. This makes imports cheaper and exports expensive, leading to a widening trade deficit and pressure on foreign exchange reserves. The IMF believes the open market is more difficult to coerce and so, by demanding that the rates align closely with each other, it was hoping the interbank rate would remain closer to the market reality.\n\nHowever, between August 28 and September 4, the difference in the market rates widened to an alarming extent both in absolute and percentage terms. For instance, on September 1, the interbank rate was Rs 305.46 per dollar while the open market rate was Rs 333 \u2014 a difference of Rs 27.54 per dollar or 8.27%. It appeared that the open market, which is less heavily regulated, was out of control. This is when multiple agencies launched a crackdown on illegal foreign exchange trade. They ramped up monitoring, placed officials at certain branches and raided offices of exchange companies suspected of being involved in conducting \u201coff-the-books\u201d deals that added to the exchange rate volatility. Consequently, the exchange rate started dropping from a high of Rs 334 on September 4. At the time of writing (September 28), the open market rate stands at Rs 289 per dollar. [You can read further details of the crackdown in Profit\u2019s September 11-17 issue].\n\nThe new structural reforms\n\nThe crackdown was followed by structural reforms unveiled on September 6. Under these reforms, the SBP encouraged leading banks actively engaged in the foreign exchange business to establish wholly owned exchange companies to cater to the legitimate needs of the public.\n\nThere are two categories of exchange companies, A and B. According to the SBP, there are 27 category A exchange companies of which two are subsidiaries of banks \u2014 Habib Bank Limited (HBL) Currency Exchange (Pvt.) Ltd. and National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) Exchange Company (Pvt.) Ltd. There are also 21 category B exchange companies. Additionally, there are also franchises.\n\nPreviously, exchange companies in category A had a higher minimum capital requirement \u2014 Rs 20 crore \u2014 while those in category B had a lower minimum capital requirement of Rs 2.5 crore. The latter could only act as money changers.\n\nUnder the reforms, all exchange companies in categories A and B along with franchises of exchange companies will be consolidated and transformed into a single category with a well-defined mandate.\n\nThe minimum capital requirement for exchange companies for category A has been bumped up from Rs 20 crore to Rs 50 crore, free of losses.\n\nCategory B exchange companies have been given three options: merge with an existing exchange company, upgrade to full exchange company status, or consolidate with other category B exchange companies to form a unified entity. They must approach the SBP within one month for a no-objection certificate (NOC) for one of these choices. After receiving the NOC, they have three months to meet regulatory and legal requirements for formal licensing, failing which, their licences will be cancelled.\n\nMeanwhile, franchises of exchange companies have been offered two options: either merge with the franchiser exchange company or sell the franchise to it. In either case, the franchises will have one month to approach the central bank for approval of the merger or sale. If they do not, their licences will be cancelled.\n\nThe goal of the reforms\n\nProfit spoke to three treasury officials from three leading banks, and two officials of a bank-owned exchange company to understand what necessitated the reforms and what the SBP hopes to achieve.\n\n(We will refer them as treasury official 1, 2 and 3)\n\nTreasury official 1 said the SBP and the law enforcement agencies involved in the recent crackdown had \u201cordered\u201d the top 10 banks to open exchange companies. While the NBP and HBL already had exchange companies, Meezan Bank Limited, Allied Bank Limited, Habib Metropolitan Bank, Bank Alfalah Limited, Faysal Bank Limited, Askari Bank Limited and Bank Al Habib Limited were also ordered to set them up. The orders \u201ccame from the very top\u201d, the source said. Many of these banks have already made announcements in this regard.\n\nIn the coming months, exchange companies in category B will cease to exist and those in category A will find it very difficult to continue operating due to higher capital requirements and punishments for minor infractions, the treasury official said. Most exchange companies are small businesses whose profits come primarily from \u201coff-the-books dealings\u201d, and they are very hard for the SBP to regulate. This is why the central bank wants them to be phased out and replaced by larger, more regulated exchange companies led by banks, he commented.\n\nAccording to treasury official 1, the SBP has directed banks to send letters of intent within one month, assuring them that licences would be granted within the next three months. These banks would then have between 10-12 months to set up at least 10 branches, or separate booths in existing branches, dedicated to foreign exchange dealings. The banks would also have internal oversight of these exchange companies.\n\n\u201cThe market will eventually be heavily regulated and banks will handle the know-your-customer requirements much better than the existing exchange companies. Walk-in customers will also be allowed to sell or purchase foreign currencies provided they have the correct documentation, including possibly tax returns for higher amounts. The purpose of [these reforms] is to ensure that all foreign exchange dealings are done cleanly, legally and on the books.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, treasury official 2 recalled that when incumbent caretaker finance minister Shamshad Akhtar was the SBP governor, she came up with the ideology of \u2018big five banks\u2019 \u2014 those \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d.\n\nThe idea is that when your paid-up capital is high, you have a significant financial investment in the business. Consequently, you cannot afford to engage in any wrongdoing because you have a substantial stake in the company. For example, if your capital is only Rs 2.5 crore, it may not make much of a difference. However, if you are required to invest Rs 50 crore, the paradigm shifts, the scale increases, and the business becomes much more professional. In such a scenario, you can no longer afford to engage in questionable activities or operate without proper adherence to regulations.\n\nMoreover, the problem with category B exchange companies and franchises is that compliance controls have regrettably shown a tendency to be less stringent. This, understandably, raises red flags for the regulatory authorities, particularly in light of their commitment to meeting the rigorous standards set forth by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nTherefore, to strengthen control and compliance, the regulator and the government want to phase out category B exchange companies and franchises. And the regulator has taken this job very seriously. In less than a month, the central bank has suspended or revoked the licences of four exchange companies.\n\nProfit reached out to the SBP\u2019s Exchange Policy Department for more clarity on its plans but an interview could not be arranged at the time of writing.\n\nThe results so far\n\nThe effects of the agencies-backed administrative measures and the resulting sentiment-driven market forces are already visible. The rupee has fallen below the Rs 300 mark in both the interbank and open markets and the premium is within the IMF-mandated range.\n\nThe rupee\u2019s appreciation is also gradual this time around, instead of volatile. It has also been very consistent, around Rs1-1.50 daily. This suggests that the recovery of the rupee is being managed in a very controlled manner, and for good reason.\n\nBecause there is excess supply of dollars in the interbank, the SBP purchases these at a certain rate (Rs1-1.50 below the previous day\u2019s closing rate) every day to remove that liquidity from the market and arrest any further weakening of the dollar during that day\u2019s trading. What happens as a result is that the USD/PKR does not drop by too much during any particular day.\n\nFor example, on Monday the market closed at 290/292. The following day on Tuesday, there is an inflow of exports and inward remittances that is well above the amount of imports and outward remittances. This means that banks cannot fully offset these inflows against their outflows and will therefore have to sell dollars in the interbank.\n\nMost banks these days are facing the same predicament and therefore the interbank is flush with supply of dollars, and if left unchecked, such liquidity can cause the dollar value against rupee to fall considerably. So what the SBP does is that it enters the interbank market and buys up this liquidity at 289.50/290.50, Rs 1.50 less than the previous day\u2019s closing rate. By doing this, it sort of mops up the excess dollars at a rate below the previous day\u2019s lowest rate. This restricts any major downward dollar movement in a single day.\n\n\u201cWhile the central bank is looking to take the USD/PKR down to a certain level, it does want to do that too rapidly as it would not only irk exporters but also encourage importers to open more LCs and those \u2018dollar investors\u2019 to start buying and hoarding again if the rate goes too low too fast\u201d, explained treasury official 1.\n\nFollowing the rupee\u2019s appreciation, exporters have rushed to bring back their export proceeds [they tend to hold their proceeds or payments abroad if they expect the rupee will depreciate and they will get more Rupees; under SBP rules, the time limit for bringing export proceeds back is 120 days]. They have booked forward proceeds amounting to $1 billion so far, according to treasury official 1.\n\nLet\u2019s say that an exporter has sold clothes worth $10 million dollars to its buyer in the US. The exchange rate on the day that he sends out his shipment \u2014 called spot or ready rate \u2014 is Rs 288. He is set to receive payment for his export in two months. However, he expects the rupee to appreciate further in that time, which means he could possibly be getting Rs 278 per dollar. To protect himself from the appreciation, he goes to a bank to book forward proceeds. The bank offers him a premium of Rs 1.5 per dollar. This essentially means that the exporter has agreed to sell his dollar proceeds (due at a later date) to the bank today, at a rate of Rs 289.5 per dollar. [There is a downside to this \u2013 the rupee may depreciate in the coming two months and he may lose money instead. If, for example, the spot rate two months later is Rs 290, he will have lost 50 paise per dollar.]\n\nExporters across the country have repeated this process multiple times. This indicates that they expect the rupee will continue to appreciate, at least in the short term. This is why the maximum period of these export forwards is just two months as opposed to six months; this recovery, in exporters\u2019 view, is not going to last more than a few weeks.\n\nHow have exchange companies reacted?\n\nThe mood among exchange companies is far from content. The recent decision to grant banking licences for exchange companies has rattled the industry, sparking strong resistance. Exchange firms view the entry of banking giants into their domain as an existential threat, with their very survival hanging in the balance.\n\nProfit spoke to Malik Bostan, chairman of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) and Zafar Paracha, general secretary of ECAP.\n\nParacha expressed his concerns bluntly, stating, \u201cThe way things are, it seems that exchange companies might be forced to shut down. If the government believes that the private sector should not exist, they should inform us, and we will close our business. The SBP doesn\u2019t even need to provide us with a roadmap.\u201d\n\nBostan lamented the crackdown on exchange companies, asserting that every sector has its \u201cblack sheep\u201d, and tarnishing the reputation of all exchange companies is unwarranted.\n\nParacha expressed his views on having the currency exchange business owned by banks. \u201cThis model will fail,\u201d Paracha put it bluntly. He argued that shutting down exchange companies could pave the way for the rise of an informal market or \u201cgrey market\u201d for foreign exchange, which would be more prone to manipulation.\n\nBostan also asserted that banks have a history of manipulating exchange rates, alleging instances where banks purchased dollars from exchange companies and subsequently charged customers higher rates, artificially inflating the dollar rates. This underscores apprehensions regarding the potential consequences of sidelining exchange companies in the foreign exchange landscape.\n\nAccording to Bostan, bank-owned exchange companies haven\u2019t seen much success.\n\nHow have banks reacted?\n\nIn a swift response to the central bank\u2019s recent reforms, United Bank Limited wasted no time in announcing its venture into the exchange company arena on September 12, six days after the reforms were rolled out. UBL\u2019s move triggered a domino effect, with a lineup of other banks swiftly joining the fray. Meezan Bank Limited joined the list three days later. In the following weeks, more banks followed suit which included MCB Bank Limited, Bank AlHabib Limited, Allied Bank Limited, and Faysal Bank Limited. HBL and NBP already had an exchange subsidiary as mentioned earlier.\n\nAn official from a bank-owned exchange company that Profit spoke to stated \u201cthis was long overdue\u201d, \u201clogical\u201d and a \u201cpositive development\u201d. He also added that they see the exchange companies and the banking sector from a treasury perspective coalescing together.\n\nAre bank-owned exchange companies lucrative?\n\nWhile speaking to Profit, both Bostan and Paracha claimed that the banks have not been successful in the exchange company business.\n\nAn official from a bank-owned exchange company disclosed that \u201cthey hardly make any revenues\u201d. He added that \u201cwe have maintained a conservative position\u201d. However, their return on equity exceeds 22%.\n\nWe also looked at the financial statements of the NBP Exchange Company. In 2022, it recorded the highest-ever return on equity of more than 30%.\n\nWhat about the new entrants? Will they be just as successful? According to treasury official 3, it is very likely that exchange companies of banks will be successful. He cited two reasons for this \u2014 first, the foreign exchange business is generally a lucrative one because banks (and exchange companies) usually have customers on both sides of the trade and they earn from the spread in both transactions, and second, better management of cash flow positions. In addition, the costs will be lower for banking exchange companies as they would be operating out of the current existing branches of the banks and most of the required hardware and software would already be present in the branch, he commented.\n\nBusiness model of a bank-owned exchange company\n\nOne of the primary sources of revenue for the bank-owned exchange company is the standard spread of buy and selling rates. These rates are set by the ECAP daily, typically at 1%. This spread serves as a limited source of income.\n\nThe other source is through positioning. The SBP permits category A exchange companies to maintain a portion of their paid-up capital in foreign exchange. This means that they can hold up to 50% of their capital in foreign currencies. This provision enables these companies to actively engage in currency trading. When the value of the dollar increases, they can generate gains due to their currency positions.\n\nConversely, if the dollar\u2019s value decreases, the exchange companies resort to reducing their position by selling the greenbacks to banks\u2019 treasury to minimise potential losses.\n\nOne of the most significant expenses incurred by the exchange company is related to Cash in Transit. The company purchases various foreign currencies like riyal, dirham, pounds, euros, and damaged cash dollars received at its counters, consolidating them at central locations \u2014 typically Karachi, Lahore, or Islamabad, depending on flight availability. These physical currencies are then sold in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, with the proceeds converted into dollars and deposited into the exchange company\u2019s NOSTRO accounts (these are essentially dollar accounts held with foreign banks).\n\nOriginally, electronic dollars in these accounts were used for settling credit card payments. However, the game changed in June when the SBP granted banks the authority to purchase US dollars from the interbank market for settling cross-border card-based transactions. As a result, the exchange company now sells various currencies, including dollars, to banks and individuals for this purpose.\n\nElectronic dollars aren\u2019t just sitting around, though. They are also withdrawn from NOSTRO accounts and handed out as physical cash to individuals. Moreover, these electronic greenbacks are used for settling imports and conducting treasury operations with other banks, being transferred to other banks\u2019 NOSTRO accounts as needed for various financial transactions.\n\nWill banks dominate the currency exchange business?\n\nLet\u2019s break it down: Imagine you\u2019re running a franchise or a category B exchange company, and suddenly, you\u2019re told to take your capital from a modest Rs 2.5 crore to a whopping Rs 50 crore in just three months. Realistically, that\u2019s a tall order, and for many, it\u2019s a challenge they might struggle to meet.\n\nSo, what happens next? Well, category B exchange companies and franchises would either merge or be forced to shut down. This would leave a gap in the market. To bridge this gap, regulators have encouraged banks to step in and play a role in this space.\n\nDoes this mean that only banks will remain in the exchange business? The short answer is no.\n\nAn official of a bank-owned exchange company told Profit that it is premature to assume that banks will outright dominate the landscape of exchange companies at this juncture. Instead, the vision is one of coexistence, where both bank-owned exchange companies and other category A players operate on a level playing field.\n\nMoreover, if we look through the lens of paid-up capital \u2013 currently, there\u2019s a club of 27 category A exchange companies, and interestingly, just two of them are bank-owned. Now, here\u2019s the fascinating part: the majority of these category A companies boast capital ranging from a substantial Rs 50 crore to an impressive Rs 1 billion.\n\nWhat does this mean in the grand scheme of things? It\u2019s a clear sign that the exchange company sector won\u2019t be exclusive territory for banks, as some market sentiments may have suggested.\n\nHowever, bank-owned or not, all category A exchange companies have to follow stringent conditions if they want to keep operating.\n\nThe survival of these businesses teeters on their ability to navigate this regulatory maze. One standout requirement demands an unrelenting 24/7 recording of transactions. These recordings encompass both audio and video footage of personnel working at the exchange counters. Companies must maintain recordings for the past six months, readily accessible at any given moment. Failure to comply with this crucial provision can result in a suspension of transaction privileges at their counters. Adding to the scrutiny, audits conducted by the SBP include meticulous examination of these recordings. The SBP cross-references recordings with transactions, demanding explanations in cases where discrepancies emerge.\n\nMoreover, conducting currency exchange transactions beyond the registered place of business is now strictly off-limits unlike in the past when one could ring up an exchange company and a company representative would deliver currency to your location or office.\n\nThe emphasis is crystal clear: only those companies meticulously adhering to compliance processes will be permitted to continue operations.\n\nWill the open market phase out?\n\nThe future of the open market and its potential convergence with the interbank market has been a subject of curiosity since banks have been rapidly establishing exchange companies.\n\nWhile some questions persist, here\u2019s what three insiders shared with Profit.\n\nAccording to an official of a bank-owned exchange company, the open market is expected to continue to exist. However, there\u2019s a crucial caveat: it will continue to exist within the framework of rules and regulations mandated by the government and regulators, something that it was not made to do very diligently by the regulator in the past. Therefore it will take some getting used to.\n\nTreasury official 3 elaborated on this, emphasising that the foreign currency cash market and the interbank market are distinct entities. While it\u2019s expected that rates will converge and the cash foreign currency market\u2019s volatility will diminish, they won\u2019t become identical. This disparity stems from various additional costs inherent to cash market transactions. One notable cost is the cost of cash in transit which arises when cash foreign currency is transferred to the NOSTRO account of the bank.\n\nConversely, Bostan believes that the gap between the open market rate and the interbank rate could potentially widen. This divergence is expected because people may choose to refrain from bringing foreign exchange into the market.\n\nWill these actions be enough?\n\nThe net result of all of this are some very encouraging news reports of the Pakistani Rupee being on its way to claim the \u2018best-performing currency title in September\u2019. That is all well and good but this thumping victory of the rupee over the dollar must be taken with a little more than a pinch of salt.\n\nYes, these gains are impressive, but are they sustainable? As we have mentioned in our previous articles, all the measures being taken are administrative in nature and they have created a sentiment in the market that the rupee will continue to make strides against the greenback, but only to a point.\n\nThe interim federal minister for industries Gohar Ejaz, who also happens to represent the largest representative body for exporters, APTMA, feels the dollar will bottom out at 260. Others feel it will be 250. But from that point onwards there will be a gradual move in the opposite direction.\n\nWhy? Because our fundamentals remain intact and unchanged. We have to make loan repayments in dollars and we have to import oil, in dollars, both of which are major outflows. And while these are being taken care of by exporters rushing to sell their dollars at the moment, there will come a point, not too long from now, that these proceeds will dry up. We are after all a net importer of goods and services.\n\nAdditionally, a weaker dollar means our exports have become expensive and therefore, there will be shrinkage in volumes as booking deals with foreign buyers will become more difficult. As far as remittances go, the rupee amounts will be getting lower as the dollar weakens in the coming weeks, so perhaps some people hold off on those as well for a bit.\n\nAdd to this the fact that a lot of export proceeds that were going to be coming in after two months and add supply to the interbank have already been factored into the market as exporter have book forwards in droves (almost $1 billion we are told). So a slight recovery by the dollar within 60 days will coincide with very little export proceeds coming in, thereby putting added pressure on the rupee-dollar parity and possibly on the current account deficit as well.\n\nThe policy to move exchange company business from the under regulated \u2018fast and loose\u2019 open market to the over regulated banking industry may not be very well liked by the open market, but it is somewhat necessary. And even though banks are not very keen on doing this, one thing is for sure, they will make it work financially for themselves and play within the confines of the SBP regulations. This will introduce much-needed formality to the currency exchange market.\n\nBut let us not fool ourselves. The vulnerabilities of our currency market remain intact. And once tested again, they will become very visible, very quickly. It remains to be seen what the \u2018shot-callers\u2019 do then.",

            "text": "Sustained efforts to combat illegal forex trading and the smuggling of foreign currency have led to approximately $1 billion being deposited in banks, as reported by the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP).\n\nZafar Paracha, General Secretary of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP), said, \u201cSince the crackdown began in September, we have successfully deposited an estimated $800 to $900 million in banks, reflecting commendable results.\u201d\n\nAs a direct result of these actions, exchange companies\u2019 daily average trading volume has surged from $5-$7 million to an impressive $50 million. Paracha added, \u201cWe are now consistently selling up to $40 million per day to the banks, with an unprecedented influx of funds from overseas Pakistanis.\u201d\n\nCurrency dealers have praised the effectiveness of administrative measures, which have yielded positive outcomes for Pakistan\u2019s economy. Policy reforms aimed at curbing Afghan transit abuse and the smuggling of Iranian oil have also played a role in preserving foreign exchange reserves.\n\nRemittances channeled through exchange companies have seen a substantial increase of 10 to 15 percent, with expectations of a corresponding rise in inflows through banks. Dealers in the banking sector anticipate that remittances in September will increase by 25 percent, reaching $2.5 billion compared to August figures.\n\nOn the other hand, State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has been actively purchasing dollars from the interbank market for debt servicing, precise figures remain undisclosed. As of September 28, the SBP held reserves amounting to $7.6 billion.\n\nBankers noted that the interbank market is witnessing heightened inflows due to the daily depreciation of the dollar, prompting exporters to sell their dollar holdings. They said that the SBP is not intervening in the exchange rate, and import restrictions have curtailed dollar outflows.\n\nThe government\u2019s measures to reduce imports have also led to a decline in the current account deficit to $2.4 billion in FY23, down from $17.5 billion the previous year.\n\nIn the open market, the dollar depreciated by Re1 to Rs280.50 on Monday. Dealers noted that sellers have been prevalent in the market, while buyers are relatively scarce, reflecting reduced demand for dollars.\n\nExperts suggest that the reforms in the Afghan Transit Agreement hold promise for Pakistan\u2019s long-term economic stability, as the agreement has historically been susceptible to exploitation by smugglers on both sides of the border.",
