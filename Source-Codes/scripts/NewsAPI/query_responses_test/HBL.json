            "text": "HBL today declared a record profit before tax of Rs 113.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2023, 47% higher than the PBT recorded in 2022. Profit after tax has increased to Rs 57.8 billion, a commendable 68% growth over last year. Earnings per share for 2023 increased to Rs 39.32, compared to Rs 23.23 in 2022. Along with the results, the Bank declared a final dividend of Rs 4.00 per share, bringing the total dividend for 2023 to Rs 9.75 per share.\n\nHBL grew its balance sheet by 19% to Rs 5.5 trillion. Deposits displayed a robust growth of 19% over 2022, closing at Rs 4.1 trillion with domestic deposits increasing by Rs 533 billion to Rs 3.5 trillion. Despite macroeconomic headwinds, HBL\u2019s total advances increased to Rs 1.9 trillion over December 2022, with Consumer loans, agriculture lending and microfinance all setting new benchmarks. Average deposits increased by nearly Rs 350 billion mostly from low-cost deposit growth.\n\nHBL\u2019s average balance sheet increased by an impressive Rs 700 billion, while rising rates translated into a 159 bps improvement in net interest margin. This drove a 46% rise in HBL\u2019s total net interest income which grew to Rs 242 billion, the highest in the industry. The Bank continued to dominate the realm of fee income, which posted yet another stellar growth of 34%, clocking in at Rs 42.3 billion in 2023. Fee growth was once again dominated by HBL\u2019s pre-eminent Cards business while trade, cash management and retail banking all delivered more than 20% increases. Total revenue thus grew by 41% to Rs 300 billion, the highest ever for HBL and in the Pakistan banking sector.\n\nThe strong revenue base helped to reduce the cost / income ratio to 56.8% in 2023. The Bank\u2019s prudent provisioning ensures that the coverage remains well above 100%. The record results also boosted the Bank\u2019s Capital Adequacy Ratio (CAR), which moved up by 118bps to over 16%, well ahead of regulatory requirements.\n\nCommenting on the Bank\u2019s performance, Muhammad Aurangzeb, President & CEO \u2013 HBL said, \u201cHBL navigated another year of economic challenges successfully, with exceptional results. This achievement stems from our unwavering commitment to client-centricity, innovation, and responsible banking practices. The Bank remained focused on delivering on three strategic pillars, which underpin its medium-term strategy namely; Growing Pakistan\u2019s Economy, Shaping the Financial Industry and Achieving Regional Relevance. We have further solidified our impact beyond profit margins through strategic partnerships and impactful initiatives. We remain grateful for the trust of our clients and are committed to exceeding their expectations. HBL is well-positioned to navigate the future and create lasting value for all stakeholders.\u201d\n\nUnder the guidance of the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) and in line with Pakistan\u2019s strategic priorities, HBL is committed to playing a leading role in developing the agricultural sector and promoting food security. HBL, together with HBL Microfinance, have extended over Rs 100 billion in loans to small farmers. Following on from its transformative initiatives in agriculture, HBL has recently incorporated HBL Zarai Services Limited an agriculture services extension company \u2013 yet another first in Pakistan. This year HBL was awarded the Best Bank for Agriculture for the 5th time in the 9 year history of the Pakistan Banking Awards.\n\nAt HBL increasing digitalization of every aspect of our businesses has become a way of life. This year, we have again introduced trailblazing products to shape Pakistan\u2019s financial services landscape \u2013 Digital Invoicing, an Urdu mobile app, TalkBack for the visually impaired. HBL has partnered with P@SHA in a landmark opportunity to showcase one of Pakistan\u2019s premier but under-celebrated sectors. From HBL Mobile to Konnect, from QR to HBL Pay, the Bank continues to raise the bar in delivering creative, first-of-a-kind solutions for its customers, cementing its position as a technology company with a banking license. In 2023, Asiamoney named HBL as the Best Bank for Digital Solutions Pakistan and the CFA Society Pakistan awarded us with the Best Digital Banking Services award.\n\nWe launched our 2nd Sustainability Report to critical acclaim by stakeholders, embarked on our progress to Net Zero and reduced our carbon footprint through solarization and a number of other activities. HBL is the first and only Pakistani bank to be a member of the Capacity-building Alliance of Sustainable Investment (CASI), launched at the recent COP28 in Dubai, which promotes best practices for sustainable finance. HBL also became a signatory to the United Nations Women\u2019s Empowerment Principles (WEPs), aligning its efforts with global initiatives to promote gender equality and women\u2019s empowerment. For its achievements in increasing women participation in the financial sector through HBL Nisa, was also awarded the \u20182023 Access to Finance Champion Award\u2019 by the Financial Alliance for Women. We provided an array of opportunities to the differently-abled, both as staff and customers. For the second year running, the Bank was recognized by the Global Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Benchmarks (GDEIB) as the Most Inclusive Organization in Pakistan, an award we truly cherish.",

            "text": "HBL Power Systems Limited ( ) shares have had a horrible month, losing 26% after a relatively good period beforehand. Regardless, last month's decline is barely a blip on the stock's price chart as it has gained a monstrous 342% in the last year.\n\nIn spite of the heavy fall in price, given close to half the companies in India have price-to-earnings ratios (or \"P/E's\") below 29x, you may still consider HBL Power Systems as a stock to avoid entirely with its 52.2x P/E ratio. Nonetheless, we'd need to dig a little deeper to determine if there is a rational basis for the highly elevated P/E.\n\nWith earnings growth that's exceedingly strong of late, HBL Power Systems has been doing very well. It seems that many are expecting the strong earnings performance to beat most other companies over the coming period, which has increased investors\u2019 willingness to pay up for the stock. You'd really hope so, otherwise you're paying a pretty hefty price for no particular reason.\n\nIs There Enough Growth For HBL Power Systems?\n\nAlthough there are no analyst estimates available for HBL Power Systems, take a look at this to see how the company stacks up on earnings, revenue and cash flow.\n\nHBL Power Systems' P/E ratio would be typical for a company that's expected to deliver very strong growth, and importantly, perform much better than the market.\n\nTaking a look back first, we see that the company grew earnings per share by an impressive 145% last year. The latest three year period has also seen an excellent 1,650% overall rise in EPS, aided by its short-term performance. Therefore, it's fair to say the earnings growth recently has been superb for the company.\n\nWeighing that recent medium-term earnings trajectory against the broader market's one-year forecast for expansion of 24% shows it's noticeably more attractive on an annualised basis.\n\nWith this information, we can see why HBL Power Systems is trading at such a high P/E compared to the market. Presumably shareholders aren't keen to offload something they believe will continue to outmanoeuvre the bourse.\n\nWhat We Can Learn From HBL Power Systems' P/E?\n\nA significant share price dive has done very little to deflate HBL Power Systems' very lofty P/E. Typically, we'd caution against reading too much into price-to-earnings ratios when settling on investment decisions, though it can reveal plenty about what other market participants think about the company.\n\nAs we suspected, our examination of HBL Power Systems revealed its three-year earnings trends are contributing to its high P/E, given they look better than current market expectations. At this stage investors feel the potential for a deterioration in earnings isn't great enough to justify a lower P/E ratio. Unless the recent medium-term conditions change, they will continue to provide strong support to the share price.\n\nA lot of potential risks can sit within a company's balance sheet. Take a look at our with six simple checks on some of these key factors.\n\nIt's important to make sure you look for a great company, not just the first idea you come across.

            "text": "Shares of HBL Power Systems have made investors richer with 2400 per cent returns in a span of just 4 years. But the gains have come off after a period of 15 years, before which the stock remained rather muted, i.e., from 2004 to 2019.\n\n\n\nBut after this period, the stock between December 2019 and December 2023 has delivered a 24-time return to its investors. The stock, which was quoting at Rs 16 in December 2019, is now trading around Rs 390.\n\n\n\nAs of Thursday's session (December 7), the stock traded with a gain of over 1 per cent at Rs 394.8. On December 4, the stock logged its all-time high of Rs 409.45 per share, while its all-time low was Rs 5.75 on July 31, 2013.\n\n\n\nWith a m-cap of Rs 10,864 crore, HBL Power Systems is a small-cap stock. The company, with a focus on engineered products and services, is engaged in the design, development, and manufacturing of specialised batteries and direct current systems in India and other engineering products.\n\nTalking about its financials, net income at the company over the last 5 years has grown at a yearly rate of 25.55 per cent, versus the industry average of 4.78 per cent. In the September quarter, net profit at the battery firm more than trebled on a year-on-year basis.\n\nGoing ahead, technicals also hint at a bullish outlook for the counter. Avdhut Bagkar, Derivatives & Technical Analyst, StoxBox, stated that the breakout above the 350 mark has sparked fresh upside in the counter, implying a bullish outlook for the month ahead. Now, if the counter succeeds in crossing the 410 level, the price action could realise a flashy move towards the 440 mark. The trend remains favourable towards a long bias, the analyst added.",

            "text": "Nuvama Institutional Equities in its latest report said any escalation in Israel-Hamas war may create opportunities for Indian players such as Bharat Forge Ltd, Larsen & Toubro Ltd (L&T), Tata Advanced Systems and Adani Group in the near-to-medium term, as Israel is likely to reach out to its allies such as India to ensure ample stockpiles for the war.\n\nNuvama noted that a few Indian companies have tie-ups with Israel including Kalyani Rafael Advanced Systems (JV of Bharat Forge and Rafael Advanced Defence Systems), Adani-Elbit JV, DCX Systems Ltd, L&T, HBL Power Systems Ltd, Tech Mahindra Ltd, Astra Microwave Ltd and Tata Advanced Systems.\n\nThe brokerage said India currently exports Brahmos missiles, artillery guns, PINAKA rockets & launchers, Dornier-228, simulators, armoured vehicles and radars.\n\nThe domestic brokerage said global demand for India's localised products, such as LCA Tejas, LCH Prachand, aircraft carriers and MRO activities are also growing.\n\n\"Given the private sector accounts for 60\u201370 per cent of India\u2019s total defence exports, we believe escalation of this ongoing Israel-Hamas war may create opportunities for players such as Bharat Forge, L&T, Tata Advanced Systems and Adani Group. in the near to medium-term as Israel would reach out to its allies (including United States) in order to have ample ammunition, defence power to fight the war,\" it said.\n\nNuvama said \u2018Make in India\u2019 initiative along with several other reforms have encouraged and opened gateways for large private players as well as MSMEs to participate and contribute to this development.\n\n\"On the other hand, expenditure on defence procurement from foreign sources has reduced from 46 per cent of overall expenditure in FY19 to 36.7 per cent by 9MFY23,\" Nuvama said. It noted that India exports defence equipment to 85-plus nations involving both subsystems/systems, which reached an all-time high of Rs 16,000 crore in FY23 from Rs 690 crore in FY14).\n\nMajor exports from India to Israel, for now, include precious stones and metals, chemical products and textiles. Israel exports pearls and precious stones, chemical and mineral/fertiliser products, machinery and electrical equipment, petroleum oils, and defence, machinery and transport equipment to India.\n\nAlso read: TCS Q2 results preview: Profit may rise 9-11%; all eyes on share buyback, dividend\n\nAlso read: Multibagger power stock headed for fresh 52-week high; hit 5% upper circuit in previous session",

            "text": "Stock broker monitor television screen at a booth, during a trading session at the Pakistan Stock Exchange, in Karachi, Pakistan. \u2014 AFP/File\n\nStocks ended on a negative note on Friday amid investors' concerns about stringent economic measures tied to the International Monetary Fund's conditions for a new loan programme, traders said.\n\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) benchmark KSE 100-share Index shed 265.57 points or 0.41 percent to close at 65,151.83 points. The highest index of the day remained at 65,534.02 points while the lowest level was recorded at 65,056.66 points. The KSE-30 index also fell by 86.52 points or 0.40 percent to 21,448.04 points.\n\nAnalyst Ahsan Mehanti from Arif Habib Corp said concerns over decisions by the SIFC for structural reforms and the impact of an IMF-mandated 18 percent GST on petroleum products' sales were key factors driving the downturn.\n\n\"Additional pressures stemmed from US concerns over election irregularities, a potential increase in industrial power tariffs, and a rise in government treasury bond yields, contributing to the bearish sentiment.\"\n\nTraded shares decreased by 181 million shares to 208.408 million shares from 389.654 million shares. The trading value dropped to Rs7.149 billion from Rs11.307 billion. Market capitalization narrowed to Rs9.170 trillion from Rs9.226 trillion. Of the 332 companies active in the session, 120 closed in green, 185 in red, and 27 remained unchanged.\n\nSeveral sectors, including exploration & production (E&P), automotive, banking, and technology, contributed negatively to the index performance, with companies such as MARI, PPL, MTL, PSO, TRG, and HBL collectively shedding 266 points.\n\nBrokerage Topline Securities in a post-market note said that a range-bound session was observed at the exchange as the index traded between its intraday high of 167 points and intraday low of 361 points to finally close at the 65,152 points level.\n\nMajor positive contributions to the index came from NBP, PSEL, MEBL, TRG, and SYS, as they cumulatively contributed 83 points to the index. On the flip side, OGDC, UBL, HBL, HUBC, and PTC lost value to weigh down on the index by 179 points.\n\nThe highest increase was recorded in Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited shares, which rose by Rs175 to Rs8,400 per share, followed by Hoechst Pakistan Limited, which increased by Rs93.87 to Rs1,353.87 per share. A significant decline was noted in Nestle Pakistan Limited, which fell by Rs310 to Rs7,200 per share, followed by Sapphire Textile Mills Limited, which closed lower by Rs75 to Rs1,525 per share.\n\nBrokerage Arif Habib Ltd said that the benchmark index experienced a modest weekly gain of 0.5 percent week-on-week, \"but faced rejection upon reaching the critical 66k level.\"\n\nIn other news, Secure Logistics Group aims to raise Rs1.19 billion, with Rs600 million through book building and Rs585 million from pre-IPO investors. Arif Habib has been appointed as the manager to the offer, with a floor price set at 12 rupees per share. Noteworthy pre-IPO investors include Saudi Bugshan and Karandaaz Pakistan.\n\n\"Looking ahead, the market may experience downside pressure within the 64-66k range in the coming week. However, there remains anticipation for an eventual breakthrough to new all-time highs,\" the brokerage added.\n\nPak Reinsurance remained the volume leader with 24.162 million shares, which closed higher by Re1.0 to Rs13.08 per share. PIAC (A) followed it with 16.544 million shares, which closed lower by Rs2.07 to Rs25.04 per share.\n\nOther significant turnover stocks included PTCL, WorldCall Telecom, Agritech Limited, Hascol Petrol, Bank of Punjab XD, Cnergyico PK, K-Electric Ltd., and Pak Int. Bulk. In the Future Market, 313 companies recorded trading, of which 99 increased, 208 decreased, and 6 remained unchanged.",

            "text": "If you're not sure where to start when looking for the next multi-bagger, there are a few key trends you should keep an eye out for. Typically, we'll want to notice a trend of growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and alongside that, an expanding base of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Speaking of which, we noticed some great changes in HBL Power Systems' ( ) returns on capital, so let's have a look.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for HBL Power Systems:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) \u00f7 (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.20 = \u20b92.2b \u00f7 (\u20b916b - \u20b94.3b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023).\n\nThus, HBL Power Systems has an ROCE of 20%. In absolute terms that's a very respectable return and compared to the Electrical industry average of 17% it's pretty much on par.\n\nWhile the past is not representative of the future, it can be helpful to know how a company has performed historically, which is why we have this chart above. If you want to delve into the historical earnings, revenue and cash flow of HBL Power Systems, check out these free .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nThe trends we've noticed at HBL Power Systems are quite reassuring. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 20%. Basically the business is earning more per dollar of capital invested and in addition to that, 44% more capital is being employed now too. So we're very much inspired by what we're seeing at HBL Power Systems thanks to its ability to profitably reinvest capital.\n\nIn another part of our analysis, we noticed that the company's ratio of current liabilities to total assets decreased to 27%, which broadly means the business is relying less on its suppliers or short-term creditors to fund its operations. This tells us that HBL Power Systems has grown its returns without a reliance on increasing their current liabilities, which we're very happy with.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nA company that is growing its returns on capital and can consistently reinvest in itself is a highly sought after trait, and that's what HBL Power Systems has. And a remarkable 1,490% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. In light of that, we think it's worth looking further into this stock because if HBL Power Systems can keep these trends up, it could have a bright future ahead.\n\nOn a final note, we found you should be aware of.\n\nHBL Power Systems is not the only stock earning high returns.

            "text": "Howard Marks put it nicely when he said that, rather than worrying about share price volatility, 'The possibility of permanent loss is the risk I worry about... and every practical investor I know worries about.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. Importantly, HBL Power Systems Limited ( ) does carry debt. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nDebt assists a business until the business has trouble paying it off, either with new capital or with free cash flow. If things get really bad, the lenders can take control of the business. However, a more frequent (but still costly) occurrence is where a company must issue shares at bargain-basement prices, permanently diluting shareholders, just to shore up its balance sheet. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. The first step when considering a company's debt levels is to consider its cash and debt together.\n\nWhat Is HBL Power Systems's Net Debt?\n\nAs you can see below, at the end of September 2023, HBL Power Systems had \u20b9990.9m of debt, up from \u20b9601.5m a year ago. Click the image for more detail. However, because it has a cash reserve of \u20b9609.3m, its net debt is less, at about \u20b9381.6m.\n\nHow Healthy Is HBL Power Systems' Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that HBL Power Systems had liabilities of \u20b94.26b due within a year, and liabilities of \u20b9664.1m falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had \u20b9609.3m in cash and \u20b94.54b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it actually has \u20b9222.7m more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nThis state of affairs indicates that HBL Power Systems' balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the \u20b9125.8b company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. But either way, HBL Power Systems has virtually no net debt, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nWe use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). The advantage of this approach is that we take into account both the absolute quantum of debt (with net debt to EBITDA) and the actual interest expenses associated with that debt (with its interest cover ratio).\n\nHBL Power Systems's net debt is only 0.15 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 179 times the size. So we're pretty relaxed about its super-conservative use of debt. On top of that, HBL Power Systems grew its EBIT by 68% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is HBL Power Systems's earnings that will influence how the balance sheet holds up in the future. So when considering debt, it's definitely worth looking at the earnings trend. .\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. In the last three years, HBL Power Systems basically broke even on a free cash flow basis. Some might say that's a concern, when it comes considering how easily it would be for it to down debt.\n\nOur View\n\nHappily, HBL Power Systems's impressive interest cover implies it has the upper hand on its debt. But the stark truth is that we are concerned by its conversion of EBIT to free cash flow. Taking all this data into account, it seems to us that HBL Power Systems takes a pretty sensible approach to debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example - HBL Power Systems has we think you should be aware of.\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

            "text": "Key Insights\n\nThe considerable ownership by private companies in HBL Power Systems indicates that they collectively have a greater say in management and business strategy\n\nAluru Family Private Trust owns 51% of the company\n\n\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of HBL Power Systems Limited ( ), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 51% to be precise, is private companies. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nAs a result, private companies as a group endured the highest losses last week after market cap fell by \u20b96.1b.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about HBL Power Systems.\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About HBL Power Systems?\n\nInstitutions typically measure themselves against a benchmark when reporting to their own investors, so they often become more enthusiastic about a stock once it's included in a major index. We would expect most companies to have some institutions on the register, especially if they are growing.\n\nSince institutions own only a small portion of HBL Power Systems, many may not have spent much time considering the stock. But it's clear that some have; and they liked it enough to buy in. So if the company itself can improve over time, we may well see more institutional buyers in the future. When multiple institutional investors want to buy shares, we often see a rising share price. The past revenue trajectory (shown below) can be an indication of future growth, but there are no guarantees.\n\nWe note that hedge funds don't have a meaningful investment in HBL Power Systems. Our data shows that Aluru Family Private Trust is the largest shareholder with 51% of shares outstanding. This implies that they have majority interest control of the future of the company. With 3.5% and 1.4% of the shares outstanding respectively, Kavita Aluru and Advay Mikkilineni are the second and third largest shareholders. Advay Mikkilineni, who is the third-largest shareholder, also happens to hold the title of Member of the Board of Directors. Furthermore, CEO Aluru Prasad is the owner of 1.3% of the company's shares.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. As far as we can tell there isn't analyst coverage of the company, so it is probably flying under the radar.\n\nInsider Ownership Of HBL Power Systems\n\nThe definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders.
