On the flip side, Mari Petroleum, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank, Habib Bank and Bank Alhabib Ltd lost value to weigh down on the index by 226 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 63,813.06 points after shedding 484.94 points or 0.75 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume further dipped by 10.39pc to 412.82 million shares. The traded value also plunged by 35.89pc to Rs16.18bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan International Airline Corporation Ltd (66.17m shares), K-Electric (47.10m shares), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (31.07m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (20.13m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (18.82m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Atlas Honda Ltd (Rs28.52), Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs25.42), JS Global Capital Ltd (Rs11.64), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs11.45) and JDW Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs10.00).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs400.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs82.29), Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs44.89), Siemens Pakistan Ltd (Rs32.01) and Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs25.00).\n\nForeign investors indulged in aggressive selling as they disposed of shares worth $10.05m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 27th, 2024",

            "short_description": "The battle for TRG is raging. Will Zia Chishti get his way again?  Profit by Pakistan Today",
            "text": "Nearly two years after its founder and CEO fell from grace following allegations of sexual assault and misconduct, one of the most traded companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) in the midst of an all out war.\n\nThe saga to wrestle control of The Resource Group (TRG) has reached the grappling on the floor stage with the company\u2019s former CEO Zia Chishti issuing full page advertisements in newspapers targeting the company\u2019s incumbent directorate and pleading with minority shareholders to pressure them to call an Extraordinary General Meeting (EOGM).\n\nWhat does Chishti hope to achieve with these tactics? As the largest single shareholder in TRG Pakistan it seems he wants back in at the helm of the company and is rearing for a hostile takeover. As of now the company\u2019s board of directors are managing to hold back the onslaught. But armed with the largest individualistic stake in TRG Pakistan and the support of other shareholders, will Chisti be able to wrest back control? For now the matter has gone to the Sindh High Court (SHC) which has put an end to any immediate EOGM being called. But how did matters get to this point for TRG?\n\nOnce in a lifetime opportunity\n\nIn the summer of 2021, things could not look better for TRG Pakistan. Its shares were some of the most traded on the PSX and as a company TRG was going from strength to strength having just announced a dividend of 44% or Rs. 4.4 in the third quarter of FY 2020-2021. The dividend was followed by the company showing earnings of Rs. 47.4 per share for the year and then gave out another sizable dividend of Rs. 4.4 per share in the first quarter of FY 2021-2022.\n\nTalk to any leading investment company or brokerage house in the country and they would tell you that TRG was a great investment specifically in the technology sector as it was expanding and growing at a rapid rate. The man behind this success was Zia Chishti. Born to a Pakistani mother and an American father, Chishti started his career as an investment banker. He went on to invent Invisalign braces and founded the company Afiniti. Initially a call-center operator, Afiniti started to identify itself as an AI pioneer, saying its software could supercharge the efficiency of call centers by matching customers with agents most likely to solve their problem or make a sale around 2017. On the back of this pitch and at a time when technology companies were getting the lion\u2019s share of new investment, it seemed nothing could stop Afiniti.\n\nDue to his Pakistani origins, Chishti kept some of his investments in his father\u2019s home country. Afiniti is partly owned by TRG (The Resource Group) Pakistan, which was created in 2002 specifically to act as the global holding company for all of TRG\u2019s investments. It was listed on the then Karachi Stock Exchange in July 2003. TRG was the original company that Chishti had founded out of which Afiniti had grown.\n\nThe ownership structure of TRG is highly complex and consists of several layers of holding companies. TRG Pakistan is the overall holding company, but it does not own the entirety of TRG International, which in turn does not necessarily own the entirety of the shares in its portfolio companies. At each stage, there are minority investors who own significant stakes, which makes it difficult to track exactly how much the overall portfolio is worth, and how much of it is owned by the shareholders of the publicly listed company on the Pakistan Stock Exchange.\n\nWhat we do know is that Chishti is the majority shareholder in TRG Pakistan and as an umbrella holding company for TRG\u2019s investments TRG Pakistan is important for Chishti to control his empire.\n\nFor most of its existence, TRG Pakistan\u2019s subsidiary was TRG International, which is a British Virgin Islands-incorporated holding company that in turn owns stakes in most of TRG\u2019s portfolio companies. However, in June 2020, TRG Pakistan\u2019s share in TRG International changed from 57.16% to 46.03%. It is no longer a subsidiary, but is instead, technically, an affiliated company. And while this means that control of TRG Pakistan does not mean control of the international company, it does give Chishti (who also has shares in the other affiliated companies) significant sway over these investments,\n\nBecause of all this Chishti was flying high in Pakistan. He was honoured with government awards and was jetting to and from Pakistan. His company was highly respected and he was a star for Pakistani investors. Until he wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe fall from grace\n\nIt is no secret why Chishti was ousted from Afiniti and then TRG as well. In November 2021, Chishti was accused of sexual assault by a former employee during a congressional hearing in the United States. The house of cards started tumbling almost immediately. Chishti stepped down as the CEO of Afiniti in the United States on the 19th of November and as CEO of TRG Pakistan soon after. He immediately came to Pakistan where an EOGM was called for TRG Pakistan. Despite his best lobbying attempts, Chishti was unceremoniously booted from the company\u2019s board of directors on the 11th of January 2022 bringing an end to his control on his own investments.\n\nBy this point it seemed clear that Chishti was out and he would go into relative obscurity. But he did not take the ouster kindly. Events since his ouster from the board of directors of TRG Pakistan show that Chisti is still looking to get his company back and is willing to be hostile to do so.\n\nA hostile takeover?\n\nEssentially what we have now is an attempt at a hostile takeover, and it isn\u2019t the first time TRG Pakistan has faced one. In fact, it was Chishti who had tried to engineer one back in October 2022 in what was his first attempt at regaining control of his companies. The October putsch was in conjunction with the JS Group which has significant shareholding in TRG Pakistan.\n\nAs a result, a petition was filed by the company in the Sindh High Court in October of 2022 which stated that Chisti, in cooperation with Jahangir Siddiqui & Company Limited with 12 other individuals, was looking to acquire shares of the company in order to take over the board of directors.\n\nIn order to take over the company, the lawsuit alleged that the JS Group was working with its partners to take over TRG Pakistan. According to laws, a group of investors can join together and buy shares of any company that they want. Associate companies, companies who have close ties to the listed company, need to disclose when they buy even a single share. JS Corporation Limited is an associate company for TRG Pakistan\n\nOnce the acquiring company buys more than 30% of shares of a company, they need to make a public offer to the market.\n\nThe public offer brings to light the fact that the acquiring company, in this case JS Group, should have made a public offer to acquire more shares which would have to be announced to the whole market. The lawsuit stated that the whole group had acquired 34% of the shares, crossing the 30% threshold, and had not made a public offer. They had acquired the shares in a surreptitious manner and had not disclosed it.\n\nOnce the lawsuit was filed, the Sindh High Court restrained the JS Group from exercising any voting control in excess of the 30% they had acquired unlawfully. The lawsuit alleged that Chishti and his group were finding ways of taking over the company by circumventing the laws and were also involved in disrupting the affairs of the company by launching social media based campaigns and filing complaints to the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in the fact that TRG Pakistan accused the \u201cChishti Group\u201d of holding more than 34 percent shares of the company while not making a public offer or proper disclosures as they are required to. It stated that JS Group owned 13.8 percent, Chishti with his wife owned 19.7 percent while DGM Securities and Al Habib Capital Markets, brokers for Chishti\u2019s wife, held 0.8 percent collectively.\n\nAfter this move was thwarted, another move was made in January 2023. Court filings again show how an attempt of a hostile takeover was thwarted. The company disclosed to the PSX that the Sindh High Court had passed an interim order on 7th January 2023 to restrain the same parties from creating a third party interest by using the shares of Chishti and his wife. Campaigns against the company itself\n\nChishti has not been sitting meekly in this entire time. And while his attempts to regain TRG Pakistan have been somehow thwarted up until now, he has had the company\u2019s current management under fire.\n\nTRG has had to take out notices at regular intervals denying any social media campaign that is being run against the directors of the company. In order to ramp up the pressure, Zia Chishti filed a defamation suit against the company which led to bailable arrest warrants being issued for the directors of the company. The directors got the warrants suspended in February 2023.\n\nThe defamation suit that was filed has also been suspended with a stay order passed by the Sindh High Court on 20th of March 2023.\n\nThe battle for the company is not only being fought against Chishti but also from within the company itself. One of the directors, Mr. Asad Nasir, has filed complaints against the company to the SECP based on the matters that were voted in December 2021 prior to the elections being held after Chishti\u2019s ouster.\n\nThe company came into focus again when an ad was taken out in the leading publications of the country. The ad goes into detail to make a case regarding the malpractices of its directors and how they are destroying the company from the inside.\n\nAccessing the links given in the ad showed that there was no such website and there is no name or contact information in the ad itself. The site being referenced has come online much later with a group being made on Facebook. We now know, based on a court order filed by TRG Pakistan, that the ads were an attempt by Chishti to unite the shareholders and ask for an EOGM to be called.\n\nThe ad and the new TRG management\u2019s response\n\nThe ad that has been published accuses the current CEO and a director at the company with two other directors of destroying the value of the company while they pursue their own interest. The ad goes on to say that Mr. Aslam with Mr. Mohammad Khaishgi and Mr. John Leone, two other directors, have little stake in the company and have taken \u201cillegal\u201d control over the company\u2019s affairs.\n\nThe ad is targeted at the shareholders who are being made aware that the company has been damaged due to operational mismanagement and that Afiniti, considered the crown jewel for TRG Pakistan, has actually seen a collapse in its revenue and equity value. Ibex, a subsidiary of the company has seen its share price crash by 50% from its peak while the company is using its cash reserves to buy its own shares using an opaque subsidiary of TRG International called Greentree Holdings Limited to allow these directors to maintain their position. Under the leadership, the revenues of the company have halved, even though the dollar has increased in value which should have been beneficial for the company. TRG Pakistan repatriates the income earned from foreign sources from dollars which should have seen an increase as the rupee depreciated.\n\nThe ad also takes aim at the other shareholders who are allowing these directors to stay in their position while the company is suffering due to mismanagement.\n\nIt has been claimed that on September 25th 2023, Mr. Zia Chishti, the largest shareholder of the company, looked to remove all the members on the board of directors and amend the Articles of Association in order to improve the governance at the company. The ad is phrased from the point of view of the shareholders of the company who are demanding for an extraordinary general meeting to be held to vote on the matter in relation to the board of directors. The ad ends with the request to join the effort in order to save the company and to share proxy votes in order to vote the present directors out.\n\nThe letter ends with making a case for holding of an EOGM by the company itself and a special agenda item can be added which would allow the directors to be retired and new directors to be elected. The goal of the meeting would be to take control away from the directors currently running the company and bring in better directors who can take the company back to its past glory.\n\nSpecific allegations being made against the directors state that the directors did not bring back $120 million in cash and $70 million in securities into Pakistan as dividends and used them to park this money into Greentree Holdings Limited which is not controlled by TRGP.\n\nAdditionally, it alleges that TRGP\u2019s voting interest in TRGI has been decreased to 45.3% even though it has an economic interest of 68.8% in the company which is not being disclosed to the shareholders. The company has given away some of its control over the board of TRGI which takes away some majority control that TRGP has over TRGI. The matter of $190 million worth of dividend was left parked at GreenTree Holdings Limited without the approval of shareholders of TRGP. Lastly, it alleges that the company withheld information of any litigation that was filed against which should be known to the shareholders.\n\nThe solution to these issues that has been given in the letter is to call an EOGM and to relieve the current directors from their posts. It claims that the current board of directors is not able to manage the situation and is allowing the three directors to mainly run the company on their behalf. While the directors need to be removed, it is also stated that articles of association need to be changed to bring the corporate governance framework of the company in compliance to Companies Act 2017. The company has not done so and follows the provisions of Companies Ordinance 1984 which has been repealed.\n\nIn response to all of this, TRG has tried to once again put out strong statements against the possibilities of Chishti regaining control of the company. On the 4th of October, the company said in a statement that \u201cany association with Zia Chishti would be highly damaging to the value of the company\u2019s underlying assets, and it is engaged in multiple lawsuits involving unlawful attempts by the ex-CEO to regain control of the company.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is with respect to newspaper advertisements published by Muhammad Ziaullah Khan Chishti attempting to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of TRG Pakistan Limited, with the agenda involving the removal of 9 out of 10 directors of the Company, as well seeking amendments to the Articles of Association of the company,\u201d read the notice to the bourse.\n\nThe small case of Annual General Meeting\n\nAccording to laws of Pakistan, a limited company registered with the SECP has to carry out an Annual General Meeting (AGM) on a yearly basis. The purpose of this meeting is to vote on certain issues and agenda items. Usually, these meetings deal with issues like appointing an auditor for the next year, pass the minutes of any pending AGM and to hash out other pending issues. As a shareholder, investors have an opportunity to put different items on the agenda which can, in their view, benefit the company.\n\nZia Chishti, as a substantial shareholder, tried to add an addendum to the AGM by looking to make M/s. Grant Thornton Anjum Rahman, Chartered Accountants, the new auditors and the Central Depository Company (CDC) the share registrar for the company. This addendum was filed on 18th October 2022 for a meeting that was announced for 25th of October.\n\nAt this point of time, a letter had been attached from M/s. Grant Thornton Anjum Rahman themselves which showed that they were interested in being appointed as auditors. It seems like Mr Chishti had gotten his way. The company was mandated to hold the AGM and had to put these agenda items to be passed or rejected at the AGM. The company outwitted Chishti by filing a request at the Sindh High Court to adjourn the meeting from being held. The Court agreed with the company and restrained the company from holding the AGM till any future notices or orders were issued. On 26th October, M/s. Grant Thornton Anjum Rahman also withdrew its consent to be the auditors for the company.\n\nAs TRG Pakistan is a listed company, one of the main battlefields that has been used by the two sides is that they have looked to accumulate shares of the company in different forms. Chishti group has looked to acquire the shares of the companies by using the JS Group and his wife\u2019s accounts to accumulate shares. This has been thwarted at different stages by the Sindh High Court due to petitions filed by the company itself. On the other hand, TRG Pakistan is using Greentree Holdings Limited. As of June 30 2021, the company did not hold even 1 share of the company. Fast forward to June end 2023 and it holds nearly 156 million or 28.54 percent of the total shares of the company.\n\nThe shareholding is a very important aspect of this battle as both sides know that holding the shares gives them power to vote on the board of directors and the general direction the company is going in. TRG Pakistan knows that an attempt was made in the earlier elections held in 2022 where Chishti wanted to be elected to the board of directors. At that time, due to the damage done to his reputation, the move might have been criticised. Now Chishti feels that he needs to get a hold of greater shareholding in the company to make an impact. Directors in Pakistan are elected for three years. The next election will be held in 2025 and it seems that this tussle will continue till then. Only time will tell what happens until then. But for now Chishti is unrelenting and the TRG management is barely holding him at bay.",

            "short_description": "'Tale of two halves', but a year to remember for Pakistan stocks  Business Recorder",
            "text": "2023 emerged as the year of turnaround for the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) as the KSE-100 hit new peaks and emerged as the best-performing asset class in the country, delivering a return of nearly 55% in the 12-month period (in rupee terms).\n\nThe KSE-100 Index signed off 2023 at 62,451.04, an increase of 22,031 points or nearly 55% in calendar year 2023.\n\nHowever, the PSX story was a tale of two halves and can be simply divided into two phases i.e. before and after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme.\n\nSource: AHL\n\nThe South Asian nation commenced 2023 engulfed in a myriad of challenges, including rising risk of debt default, unprecedented inflation figures, record-high yields on government bills, and political instability.\n\nAll these factors created a challenging market environment, especially for investors, who preferred remaining on the sidelines during the first few months of the year, while keeping a close watch on resumption of the IMF programme.\n\nThis is evident from the fact that the KSE-100 Index remained largely stagnant climbing from the 40,420 level on December 30, 2022, to 41,452.69 on June 27, 2023, reflecting a marginal increase of just 2.5%.\n\nHowever, tides shifted on June 30, during the Eid ul Azha holidays, after Pakistan managed to clinch a last-minute agreement with the IMF, as the two parties reached an agreement on policies to be supported by a $3-billion, nine-month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA).\n\nThe new IMF arrangement, seen as a massive positive for the government and the economy reeling from crisis, not only extended Pakistan\u2019s commitment with the lender well into the second half of fiscal year 2023-24, but also was an upgrade from the earlier expectation that the country would receive $1.1 billion after the ninth review.\n\n\u201cThe IMF SBA was a breakthrough, which dictated the trajectory of the stock market,\u201d Mahroz Khan, analyst at Optimus Digital, told Business Recorder.\n\nSimilar sentiments were provided by other market analysts as the resumption of the IMF programme ensured policy stability.\n\n\u201cFrom 2017 onwards, the performance of PSX was quite rangebound, as stock valuations remain fairly low despite strong corporate performance,\u201d said Mustafa Pasha, Chief Investment Officer at Lakson Investments.\n\n\u201cThe IMF programme emerged as a trigger point, as the risk of default was averted which pumped confidence among the investors,\u201d he said.\n\nThe impact was evident as the benchmark KSE-100 Index jumped from 41,452.69 on June 27, 2023 to 62,451.04 on December 29, 2023, the last trading session of the calendar year, registering a massive growth of nearly 51%.\n\nFollowing the IMF programme, another major positive for the stock market was the smooth transition of power to the interim government setup as a caretaker cabinet under interim Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar, tasked with running the country until fresh elections, took charge in August.\n\n\u201cThis diminished much uncertainty on the political front,\u201d said an analyst.\n\nWhat followed was a series of measures taken by the interim government including State Bank of Pakistan \u201cstructural reforms\u201d for the Exchange Companies and the administrative steps against smugglers and hoarding of currency and illegal exchanges, which stabilized the rupee while adding to investor confidence.\n\n\u201cMeasures in the energy sector, especially the gas price hike, was a key, as this alleviated the issue of circular debt in the index-heavy energy sector,\u201d said Mahroz Khan.\n\n\u201cAs a result, the performance of E&P sector improved, which also trickled down to the banking sector driving the stock market upwards\u201d, he said.\n\nMoreover, continuous talks with the Washington-based lender and improvement in rupee value kept the investors upbeat, as the PSX crossed the coveted 50,000 mark on October 19, a milestone achieved after over six years.\n\nThe momentum persisted in the following weeks and the stock market continued to ink new records with every passing trading session. The increased participation of foreign investors in particular was a sign that businesses were expecting an up cycle amid hopes of recovery in the country\u2019s economy.\n\nIn November, Pakistan\u2019s stock market saw the highest monthly net inflow of foreign portfolio investment in four years, as international corporates purchased shares worth $66 million and sold $31 million in November, resulting in a net buying of $35 million, the highest monthly inflow since 2017.\n\nDuring the same month i.e. November 15, the IMF staff and Pakistani authorities reached an agreement on the first review of the $3-billion, nine-month SBA., which as expected further bolstered the equities, that were already enjoying a buying spree on account of attractive valuations and improved macroeconomic indicators.\n\nThus, the PSX continued its upward march well into the final weeks of the year hitting the highest-ever level of 66,426 on December 12. Meanwhile, despite some hiccups, which many analysts termed as much-needed correction, the stock market signed off the year on a bullish note.\n\n\u201cSectors contributing positively to index include banks (7,162 points), fertilizer (2,661 points), E&P (2,553 points), Power (2,470 points) and cement (2,148 points),\u201d said Arif Habib Limited, a brokerage house in its latest report.\n\n\u201cHowever, the laggards comprised of technology (-452 points) followed by miscellaneous (-170 points), textile spinning (-10 points), and vanaspati (-9 points).\u201d\n\n\u201cMeanwhile, scrip wise top contributions to the upside were HUBC (2,077 points, 84% of total power sector contribution), UBL (1,611 points, 22% of total banking sector contribution), HBL (1,035 points, 14% of total banking sector) and MCB (1,031 points, 14% of total banking sector).\n\n\u201cScrip wise negative contributors were i) TRG (-317 points), ii) PSEL (-308 points), and iii) SYS (-237 points).\u201d\n\nA dismal year for IPOs\n\nDespite achieving new highs, the year 2023 was not good for Initial Public Offerings IPO as the Pakistani equities market saw just one IPO i.e. Symmetry Group that managed to raise a meager Rs435 million funds. This was the lowest amount raised in a year in the past decade and half of the previous record low of Rs800 million seen in 2013, shared Topline Securities.\n\n\u201cWe attribute this bad IPO trend to macro-economic instability, coupled with the looming threat of default, cheap valuations and political uncertainty discouraging equity investment,\u201d the brokerage house said in a report.\n\nMeanwhile, Murtaza Jafer, Director of Equity Sales at Optimus Capital, blamed the trend on low valuations in the market, which didn\u2019t help attract much interest.\n\n\u201cHowever, I believe we would see a lot of listings post-general elections,\u201d he said.\n\nPSX Outlook\n\nMarket experts believe that despite the record showing in 2023, PSX has more to achieve in the coming months, as market valuations remain attractive.\n\n\u201c2023 was a year of recovery, however, I believe it is just a start,\u201d said Pasha.\n\n\u201cThe KSE-100 index may climb to 85-90k level by the end of 2024.\n\n\u201cHowever, for that timely elections must be held, while a new IMF agreement should also be inked by the elected government. These will be the key macro triggers that will dictate the future market trajectory,\u201d he added.\n\nOther experts also echoed similar views.\n\n\u201cTimely elections are important, both for the general as well as the business community,\u201d said Mahroz Khan.\n\nKhan was of the view that under the new IMF agreement, expected to be reached next year, the lender is likely to stress increasing the country\u2019s tax base, which remains very low.\n\n\u201cEven after the recent rally of 50%+ we believe there is much room for upside,\u201d Amreen Soorani, Head of Research at JS Global, told Business Recorder, as she added that the KSE-100 Index is still trading on attractive multiples.\n\nThe market\u2019s current price-to-earnings P/E (blue chips) is still close to 3x and still reflects a discount of ~40% to the Index\u2019s recent mean of multiples, she said.\n\n\u201c(However) For the continuity of the rally, it would be very important for the ongoing developments on the macro front to continue and for the government to ensure the country\u2019s gross financing needs are met, keeping PKR depreciation as gradual as possible,\u201d Amreen added.",
