            "text": "Stock brokers attend phone calls and monitor share prices on their computers during a trading session at the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachi on December 19, 2023. \u2014 AFP\n\nStock plunged more than 1000 points on Friday, as investors were rattled by the political uncertainty over the formation of a new government and the economic challenges facing the country, dealers said\n\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) benchmark KSE 100-share Index closed lower by 1,147.10 points or 1.88 percent to 59,872.96 points against 61,020.06 points recorded in the last session.\n\nThe highest index of the day remained at 61,173.31 points while the lowest level was recorded at 59,739.47 points. The KSE-30 index also fell by 382.10 points or 1.87 percent to 20,099.31 points.\n\nAhsan Mehanti, an analyst at Arif Habib Corp, said stocks fell sharply lower amid dismal data on LSM growth for July- Dec\u201923 and reports of Pakistan downgrade to the authoritarian regime by Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU).\n\n\"Unclarity over coalitions\u2019 power-sharing formula, IMF\u2019s new conditions over the next $1.2 billion tranche under SBA to liberalise imports, and cabinet approvals over the increase in gas prices played a catalytic role in the bearish close.\"\n\nTraded shares decreased by 31 million shares to 314.247 million shares from 345.126 million shares. The trading value rose to Rs12.243 billion from Rs11.873 billion. Market capital narrowed to Rs8.717 trillion against Rs8.883 trillion. Out of 331 companies active in the session, 77 closed in green, 238 in red and 16 remained unchanged.\n\nAnalyst Ali Najib at Topline Securities said equities commenced the day on a negative note, remained \"negative for most of the business hours as the benchmark index made an intraday low at 59,740 level (down 1,281 points) and ultimately closed the business hours at 59,873 level (lost 1,147 points; down 1.88 percent)\".\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s pessimism goes to continuous uncertainty over the political front with respect to the formation of upcoming coalition set up as political parties are yet to arrive on conclusion in this regard.\u201d\n\nDuring the day, E&P, power, tech & cement sectors contributed negatively to the index as OGDC, HUBC, PPL, SYS, MARI & LUCK lost 465 points, cumulatively.\n\nThe highest increase was recorded in Bhanero Textile Mills Limited, which rose by Rs69.38 to Rs994.38 per share, followed by Hallmark Company Limited, which increased by Rs22.67 to Rs325.45 per share. A significant decline was noted in Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited, which fell by Rs134.35 to Rs8,365.65 per share, followed by Mari Petroleum Company Limited, which closed lower by Rs68.86 to Rs2,198.25 per share.\n\nBrokerage Arif Habib Ltd said the index concluded the week with a close below 60,000 points level, registering a significant 5.14 percent decline week-on-week (WoW). \"As the market edges closer to the 59,000 points target set for February, it enters a seasonally weak period,\" the brokerage said.\n\nIn recent developments, the Federal Cabinet approved a weighted average gas price increase of +12.3 percent to PKR 1,533/mmbtu. This decision aligns with the IMF's conditions for the upcoming second review of the Standby Arrangement, indicating continued adherence to IMF directives.\n\n\"Protests anticipated over the weekend are likely to exert further pressure on the market in the coming week. The prevailing bias remains tilted to the downside, with resistance expected around the 62,000 points level.\"\n\nK-Electric Ltd. remained the volume leader with 41.835 million shares which closed lower by 23 paisas to Rs4.10 per share. WorldCall Telecom followed it with 25.778 million shares, which closed lower by 4 paisas to Rs1.21 per share.\n\nOther significant turnover stocks included Oil & Gas Dev., Pak Refinery, P.I.A.C.(A), Pak Petroleum, B.O. Punjab, Engro Fert., Agritech Limited and Silk Bank Ltd. In Future\u2019s Market, 319 companies recorded trading, of which 38 increased, 280 decreased and one remained unchanged.",

            "short_description": "Here's What Happened in Pakistan's Banking Sector in 2023  ProPakistani",
            "text": "The banking sector in Pakistan maintained robust growth in profitability during 2023, including growth in assets and deposits, the high-interest rate regime allowed them to make handsome margins, increase investment in securities, and lend cash to the federal government at exorbitant financing rates.\n\nOn the other hand, they attracted deposits from customers, providing them with handsome returns too. There have also been major transformations and developments in a few commercial banks, which will impact the banking sector positively in the long term.\n\nALSO READ Bank Alfalah Launches Pakistan\u2019s First Digital Payments Sales and Service Centers Focusing on Merchants and Small Businesses\n\nSome of the initiatives taken by different commercial banks will be followed by other competing banks in the near future. Below are a few major developments that happened during 2023:\n\n(1) Faysal Bank\u2019s Conversion to Islamic Bank\n\nFaysal Bank announced its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank on the first day of the calendar year. The bank converted its assets, deposits, operations, branches, and licenses from conventional to Sharia-based banks and became the second-biggest Islamic bank in the banking industry.\n\nThis transition is said to be the biggest conversion of any conventional bank, not only in Pakistan but in the world, considering the size of the operation. The transformation of Faysal Bank also provided a roadmap for other banks seeking to convert their operations from conventional to Islamic.\n\n(2) MCB Bank Acquires 81% Stake in Asset Management Company\n\nMCB Bank acquired an additional 30 percent stake in its subsidiary, MCBAH Savings and Investments, at the cost of Rs. 649 million. Through this deal, the bank received 21.6 million shares, or 30 percent, of another sponsor, Arif Habib Corporation, at a share price of Rs. 30. Hence, its overall shareholding in the subsidiary increased to over 81 percent from 51 percent.\n\nMCB-AH Limited is one of the leading asset management companies in the fund management sector, and a few companies within a sector are also listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The transition in shareholding will strengthen the position of the bank in the financial sector.\n\n(3) JS Bank Acquires Major Shareholding in BankIslami\n\nJS Bank Acquired major shares in BankIslami to convert the Islamic bank into its subsidiary with ownership of the significant shareholding. The bank increased its stakes in the Islamic bank by 75 percent by purchasing shares from the parent financial entity, JS Group.\n\nThe share swap deal was successful between the sponsors of the Islamic bank, despite being challenged in the Sindh High Court. JS Bank maintained a different strategic position, which will increase its profitability and influence in the banking industry after this deal.\n\n(4) Prominent Banks Plan for Conversion to Islamic Banking\n\nProminent conventional banks with a separate division of Islamic banking announced their plans for full-fledged conversion to Islamic Banking in light of a verdict issued by the Federal Shariat Court last year.\n\nThe banks included the Bank of Punjab, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, and Summit Bank. In this regard, the Bank of Punjab hired a consultant, and Summit Bank rebranded itself as Mukramah Bank. This transition in banking operations will likely attract different conventional banks to follow the same suit.\n\nALSO READ Financial Irregularities Worth Rs.14 Billion Allegedly Uncovered During PSL Audit\n\n(5) Bank Alfalah Acquires Stakes in QistBazaar\n\nBank Alfalah acquired 7.2 percent stakes in BNPL QistBazaar at a cost of Rs. 140 million. The deal can be a win-win situation for both entities in scaling up their business and profitability.\n\nIn addition to the equity agreement, Bank Alfalah, and QistBazaar signed an embedded financing agreement in Shariah-compliant mode for up to Rs. 350 million. Accordingly, the bank will incorporate digital financing products within the QistBazaar platform to offer embedded consumer durables financing in BNPL\u2019s mode.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s move to invest in QistBazaar can prove a stepping stone to strengthening the fintech landscape of the country, as more banks are likely to follow suit for collaboration and investment in fintech companies, which is the need of the hour.\n\n(6) Major Banks to Set up Exchange Companies\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) plans to streamline the business of foreign exchange across the country with control and regulation on trade and flows of foreign currencies, mainly to monitor the stability of the rupee against the dollar. In this regard, the banking industry watched as various exchange companies in Category B shut down while commercial banks were allowed to establish their foreign exchange subsidiaries as an alternate option in the financial sector.\n\nAn overwhelming number of banks made announcements to set up subsidiaries of foreign exchange, including HBL, UBL, MCB, Bank Al Habib, Meezan Bank, Habib Metro Bank, Askari Bank, etc.\n\n(7) Summit Bank Receives Investment from UAE\n\nSummit Bank received a significant capital injection of Rs. 10 billion from its sponsor and prominent UAE investor, Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah.\n\nThe investor subscribed to 3.98 billion new shares of the bank at Rs. 2.51 per share, becoming the major shareholder in the bank. Moreover, Summit Bank plans to convert its entire operation from a conventional banking system to an Islamic one, similar to Faysal Bank. Its board of directors also approved a three-year conversion plan, and the bank has been renamed Bank Makramah Limited\n\n(8) Silk Bank Attracts Investors\n\nSilk Bank, once again, sought the financial support of a strong investor on a long-term basis to fulfill its regulatory requirements of paid-up capital and the sustainability of its profitable operations.\n\nThe bank has attracted interest from MCB Bank, United Bank Limited, International Commercial Bank of South Sudan, and Pakistan Housing Finance Company for investment and merger. At present, these financial institutions are carrying out the due diligence of the bank, which is showing the increasing competition among these entities in striking a deal with Silk Bank.\n\nSudanese Bank and Pakistan Housing Company even expressed their investment plans of 50 million euros and Rs. 12 billion, respectively. With four proposals in hand, it is a good time for Silk Bank to say yes to at least one institution with remarkable experience in local industry and operating a subsidiary.\n\nALSO READ State Bank Fails to Satisfy Panel in Rs. 70 Billion Money Laundering Scandal\n\n(9) Meezan Bank Collaborates to Launch Islamic Microfinance Services\n\nMeezan Bank took the initiative to collaborate with SAFCO Microfinance Company Private Limited (SMCL) for the launch of Islamic microfinance services in the low-income segment of society.\n\nThis is the first time that a commercial bank has significantly supported a microfinance institution. The leading Islamic bank has committed to providing Rs. 100 million in financing and technical support for product development, capacity building, and training for the microfinance company.\n\nThe step will further accelerate the penetration of Islamic banking across the country. The microfinance company established its inaugural Islamic microfinance branch under the brand name \u2018Yaqeen\u2019 in Hyderabad, Pakistan.\n\n(10) HBL to Set Up a Specialized Agri Subsidiary\n\nHabib Bank Limited received approval from the State Bank of Pakistan to set up a specialized subsidiary for the agriculture sector. The subsidiary will work to provide financial access to farmers and other players in the agriculture sector, particularly, but the institution has plans to be deeply involved in the sector\u2019s development.\n\nThe leading bank previously carried out different projects successfully in this sector, which gave it the confidence to enhance its footprints in the food sector with a much bigger role and a long-term profitable engagement. The out-of-box approach of the bank\u2019s leadership might give it a competitive edge in the industry.",
