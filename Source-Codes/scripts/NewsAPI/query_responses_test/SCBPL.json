            "text": "watch now\n\nStandard Chartered shares slid Thursday as the bank's big bet on China hit a stumbling block, leading to significant losses in the country. Shares of the Asia-focused bank tanked as much as 17% in early deals in London, sparking a temporary halt in trade. The London-listed stock later closed 12% lower. The U.K.-headquartered bank reported pre-tax profit of $633 million for the third quarter \u2014 a 54% drop from the same period last year. The result was hit by the bank slashing the value of its investment in China Bohai Bank by $697 million. Standard Chartered also announced a credit impairment charge of $294 million \u2014 up $62 million on the year \u2014 including a $186 million charge relating to the China commercial real estate sector.\n\nStock Chart Icon Stock chart icon Standard Chartered shares\n\nStandard Bank Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford on Thursday told CNBC's \"Squawk Box Europe\" that the \"overall performance of the bank is very strong,\" despite the China news. Halford noted that China's commercial real estate sector \"clearly has been problematic,\" but said that GDP in the country is forecast to bounce back around 5% within the next two to three years. \"What we're seeing is probably a slower recovery post-Covid than in some countries. But it's a huge population to mobilize after such a big event,\" Halford said. \"Most countries would be more than happy to have that kind of growth level,\" Halford said. \"So we are very, very much of the view that this is a period that we need to go through. We'll stick with it [and] as the economy gets going, then that should be good with us and should be good for others.\" China's economic recovery has broadly disappointed since the end of the Covid-19 pandemic, although its third-quarter growth came in stronger than expected, boosting hopes that things could be about to turn around.\n\n'A blessing and a curse'",

            "text": "Standard Chartered Plc has committed to returning additional funds to its shareholders while outlining initiatives to enhance returns and streamline operations at the emerging markets-centered bank\n\nWith fourth-quarter profits surpassing analyst predictions, the London-based institution announced plans to initiate a new $1 billion share buyback program. The \"Fit for Growth\" initiative is projected to yield approximately $1.5 billion in expense reductions over the forthcoming three years. However, it is expected to incur a corresponding sum in costs due to the implementation of permanent organizational adjustments.\n\nAlso read: What to do if you have a Paytm UPI handle? RBI advises this\n\nBill Winters, the Chief Executive Officer who has been with the company for nearly nine years, has been actively seeking methods to enhance returns for shareholders and revitalize the stock, which has declined by over 15% in the last year. During a press conference on Friday, he candidly referred to the share price as \"poor,\" emphasizing his commitment to altering the market's perception of the bank.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not happy with the share price at all,\" Winters was quoted as saying by Bloomberg. He further said, \"The market has a sense that it\u2019s hard to get things done at Standard Chartered and this Fit for Growth program is going to tackle that head on.\"\n\nStandard Chartered reported a significant increase in its adjusted pretax profit, soaring by 63% to $1.06 billion for the three months ending in December, surpassing the estimated $989.6 million.\n\nAlso read: Zee Ent forms independent advisory committee headed by ex-HC judge amid negative public opinion\n\nThe bank announced a final dividend of 21 cents per share, marking a 50 percent increase in the full-year payout. Additionally, it revealed new strategic targets, aiming for a 12 percent return on tangible equity by 2026 and anticipating a growth in operating income between 5 percent to 7 percent for the years 2024 to 2026.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg report, Standard Chartered shares have performed poorly in recent months and are almost 40% below the level they were when Winters joined the bank in June 2015, despite its exposure to some of the world\u2019s fastest growing markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East.\n\nStandard Chartered reported a decrease in profits during the third quarter, attributed to charges linked to investments in China. Similarly, its larger competitor, HSBC Holdings Plc, experienced a profit setback earlier in the week due to impairments on investments in China. The country's weak confidence and an enduring crisis in its real estate market have plagued these investments, affecting the financial performance of both banking giants.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve taken very material provisions there, well ahead of our peers who have investments in Chinese banks,\" Winters told reporters on a media call.\n\nStanChart saw heavy selloff in its shares when it announced its third-quarter earnings as investors reacted to news of fresh charges against Chinese real estate and a $700 million impairment on its stake in China Bohai Bank. The stock tumbled more than 12% on Oct. 26, its biggest loss since August 2012.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s plan to keep costs below $12 billion in 2026 and its revenue\u2019s lowered sensitivity to rate cuts are critical to keeping operating jaws positive and delivering its new guidance of 12% return on tangible equity in two years, some 200-bps above consensus, says the Bloomberg report. A $1 billion buyback and $5 billion total return plan by 2026 is also incrementally positive.\n\n(With inputs from Bloomberg)\n\nMilestone Alert!

            "text": "Goldman Sachs has upgraded its rating on multinational banking group Standard Chartered from 'neutral' to 'buy', saying that upside risk isn't reflected in the current share price.\n\nThe stock currently trades close to record-low valuations, despite a near-decade-high return on tangible equity of 11% next year, and offering a 10% total capital return yield, Goldman said.\n\nMeanwhile, StanChart is set to show a \"rare out-performance relative to its bank peers over the next two years\", according to Goldman.\n\nAnalysts expect the bank to deliver a double-digit compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in earnings per share (EPS) and a 2.7 percentage-point improvement in return on equity (ROE), compared with low single-digit EPS CAGR and declining ROE at peer banks.\n\nGoldman said that improvements in EPS and ROE will be driven by four factors: an unwind of loss-making hedges put-on by the group during late 2021, starting in February 24; a better outlook for non-funds income; a new chief financial officer to be appointed next year who could focus on the outsized corporate office function relative to its peers; and the possibility for continued buyback with capital now at the top-end of the target range.\n\nThird-quarter results from StanChart last month came in about 10% below consensus forecasts on a pre-tax profit level. \"We expect 4Q23 results delivery to be cleaner, in-line with expectations, and to be further supported by a c.US$750mn buy-back announcement. The stock tends to react to earnings and can rise into a potential buy-back,\" Goldman said.\n\nGoldman cut its target price for the shares from 879p to 868p.\n\nThe stock was up 0.8% at 665.2p by 1008 GMT.",

            "short_description": "Those who invested in Standard Chartered (LON:STAN) three years ago are up 115%  Yahoo Finance",
            "text": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But when you pick a company that is really flourishing, you can make more than 100%. For example, the Standard Chartered PLC (LON:STAN) share price has soared 103% in the last three years. How nice for those who held the stock! In the last week shares have slid back 1.0%.\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nView our latest analysis for Standard Chartered\n\nWhile markets are a powerful pricing mechanism, share prices reflect investor sentiment, not just underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nStandard Chartered was able to grow its EPS at 33% per year over three years, sending the share price higher. This EPS growth is higher than the 27% average annual increase in the share price. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. This cautious sentiment is reflected in its (fairly low) P/E ratio of 8.64.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nWe know that Standard Chartered has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on how its financial position has changed over time.\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. Arguably, the TSR gives a more comprehensive picture of the return generated by a stock. In the case of Standard Chartered, it has a TSR of 115% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence!\n\nStory continues\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWe're pleased to report that Standard Chartered shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 42% over one year. Of course, that includes the dividend. Since the one-year TSR is better than the five-year TSR (the latter coming in at 8% per year), it would seem that the stock's performance has improved in recent times. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. Take risks, for example - Standard Chartered has 1 warning sign we think you should be aware of.\n\nBut note: Standard Chartered may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with past earnings growth (and further growth forecast).\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on British exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

            "text": "One simple way to benefit from the stock market is to buy an index fund. But if you pick the right individual stocks, you could make more than that. Just take a look at Standard Chartered PLC ( ), which is up 33%, over three years, soundly beating the market return of 1.2% (not including dividends).\n\nWith that in mind, it's worth seeing if the company's underlying fundamentals have been the driver of long term performance, or if there are some discrepancies.\n\nThere is no denying that markets are sometimes efficient, but prices do not always reflect underlying business performance. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nDuring three years of share price growth, Standard Chartered achieved compound earnings per share growth of 52% per year. The average annual share price increase of 10% is actually lower than the EPS growth. So it seems investors have become more cautious about the company, over time. We'd venture the lowish P/E ratio of 10.89 also reflects the negative sentiment around the stock.\n\nThe image below shows how EPS has tracked over time (if you click on the image you can see greater detail).\n\nWe know that Standard Chartered has improved its bottom line over the last three years, but what does the future have in store? You can see how its balance sheet has strengthened (or weakened) over time in this free .\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nIt is important to consider the total shareholder return, as well as the share price return, for any given stock. The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Standard Chartered, it has a TSR of 41% for the last 3 years. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. The dividends paid by the company have thusly boosted the total shareholder return.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nWhile the broader market lost about 3.3% in the twelve months, Standard Chartered shareholders did even worse, losing 10% (even including dividends). However, it could simply be that the share price has been impacted by broader market jitters. It might be worth keeping an eye on the fundamentals, in case there's a good opportunity. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 0.9%, each year, over five years. If the fundamental data continues to indicate long term sustainable growth, the current sell-off could be an opportunity worth considering. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Standard Chartered better, we need to consider many other factors. Even so, be aware that , you should know about...\n\nFor those who like to find winning investments this free\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on British exchanges.\n\nValuation is complex, but we're helping make it simple.

            "text": "The lender, one of Hong Kong\u2019s three currency-issuing banks, announced a fresh share buy-back of US$1 billion and said it had paid 27 US cents as dividend in the full year in 2023, 50 per cent higher than 18 US cents per share a year ago.\n\nThe emerging-markets focused lender posted a net profit of US$3.47billion in 2023, or US$1.08 per share, against a profit of US$2.95 billion posted a year ago. This is better than analysts\u2019 estimate of US$3.34 billion.\n\nStandard Chartered, reiterated its positive view on Hong Kong, the lender\u2019s single largest market, after it reported an 18 per cent jump in profit for 2023, beating street estimates as its bottom line was driven by higher interest income and a wealth management boom.\n\nThe London-based bank, which generates much of its revenues from Asia, reported US$5.09 billion in statutory pre-tax profit for 2023, up 19 per cent from US$4.28 billion in 2022, missing the US$5.39 billion estimate made by analysts in a Bloomberg poll.\n\nExterior of the Standard Chartered Exchange Square Branch in Central. Photo: Jonathan Wong\n\nUnderlying pre-tax profit in Hong Kong, its single largest market, rose 77 per cent to US$1.85 billion, a strong performance that Standard Chartered CEO Bill Winters said showed the city\u2019s potential.\n\n\u201cFrom our perspective, Hong Kong\u2019s record income, super growth, outstanding franchise, and huge connector role between mainland China and the rest of the world is what makes Hong Kong the heart of our business,\u201d he said when asked about a recent opinion piece by former Morgan Stanley chief economist Stephen Roach titled \u201cIt pains me to say Hong Kong is over\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt is a business as strong as it has ever been,\u201d said Winters while adding the internationalisation of the Chinese currency yuan, the development of the Greater Bay Area and the expansion of wealth management businesses will drive the city forward.\n\n\u201cClearly one of the areas of strength has been the wealth management products in Hong Kong, and also Singapore,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThe wealth trends in Asia are inexorable. They are very strong and we can look forward to high single digits, low double-digit growth in underlying wealth, and Hong Kong has been and will continue to be at the centre of that. Singapore, of course, is also doing quite well.\u201d\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s Hong Kong CEO Mary Huen Wai-yi said an expected cut in interest rates this year will help boost loan growth.\n\n\u201cIn general, when the interest rate goes lower, demand for loans and wealth management products increases,\u201d she said in a media briefing in Hong Kong on Friday afternoon.\n\nWinters said the bank will continue to actively manage the group\u2019s capital position with a target to return at least US$5 billion to shareholders over the next three years.\n\nStandard Chartered set aside an aggregate US$1.2 billion towards credit impairment charges related to its exposure in China\u2019s commercial real estate sector, over the past three years.\n\n\u201cWe are very well provided for it right now,\u201d he said.\n\nIn 2023, the situation appeared to be less gloomy with credit impairment charges related to its China commercial real estate business falling to US$282 million from US$582 million in 2022. This reduced the bank\u2019s overall bad debt charges by 37 per cent year on year to US$528 million in 2023.\n\nFor the fourth quarter alone, Standard Chartered reported that its underlying pre-tax profit rose 74 per cent to US$1.1 billion.\n\nShares of Standard Chartered rose 3.7 per cent on Friday to close at HK$62.45 after the result announcement at Friday lunch break, its highest since November.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s performance was also hit by an impairment charge related to its investment in China Bohai Bank, which reduced the carrying value of its investment by US$850 million. It is one the founding shareholders of the Tianjin-based joint-stock commercial bank set up in 2006.\n\nOn Wednesday, HSBC reported its pre-tax profit for the fourth quarter dropped 80 per cent to US$1 billion, mainly due to a US$3 billion impairment charge on its 19.03 per cent stake in mainland lender Bank of Communications, caused by a reduction in its carrying value of investments.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s Asia business, which provides most of its revenues and profitability, made an underlying pre-tax profit of US$4.74 billion in 2023, an increase of 32 per cent from a year earlier.\n\nThe lender\u2019s Africa and Middle East profit rose 90 per cent to US$1.31 billion during the same period under review.\n\nIn contrast, the bank\u2019s Europe and America operations reported a loss of US$330 million in 2023, compared with a gain of US$834 million in 2022.\n\nIts net interest margin, an important measure of a bank\u2019s profitability, rose to 1.67 per cent in 2023, from 1.41 per cent a year earlier.\n\nA widened margin helped boost Standard Chartered\u2019s net interest income by 23 per cent to US$9.6 billion. Operating income, the equivalent of revenue in US accounting terms, rose 10 per cent to US$17.4 billion in 2023 at constant currency exchange rate.\n\nAnother key unit, the consumer, private banking and wealth management business, saw a 60 per cent profit growth during the year under review. The lender has rolled out a swathe of wealth management centres in recent years to tap the investment demand of the wealthy. Its corporate banking profit also increased 42 per cent last year.\n\nProfits were offset by losses in its new digital banking business. Its SC Ventures business losses widened by 12 per cent year on year to underlying pre-tax loss of US$408 million in 2023. The segment includes majority owned virtual banks, Mox in Hong Kong and Trust in Singapore.",

That has led to a perception that costs have remained too high.\n\nThe FTSE 100 bank took a small $153m hit on its stake in China Bohai Bank, a specialist lender based in the port city of Tianjin. It also booked a $282m charge from problems in Chinese commercial real estate amid a wider downturn in the country.\n\nThe crisis in commercial property has hit China\u2019s economy hard, shaving around 2pc off its traditionally strong growth which dropped to 5.2pc last year.\n\nWinters said he was not \u201cbullish or bearish\u201d on China because the country was going through a transition from older industries like property to tech and consumer.\n\nThe risk of a fresh trade war between the US and China if President Trump gets re-elected was also less of a risk than some feared due to President Biden\u2019s similar approach.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s a Trump overhang,\u201d he said. \u201cI think there\u2019s a US-China political tension overhang.\n\n\u201cIt was kicked off in earnest by Trump but Biden has rolled back nothing and extended quite a bit.\u201d\n\nPre-tax profits for the final three months ending December 2023 rose to $1.1bn. The full year profit was up 19pc to $5.1bn.",

The firm said a new \"Fit for Growth\" program will save about $1.5 billion in expenses over the next three years, but also add a similar amount to costs for the permanent organizational changes.\n\nChief Executive Officer Bill Winters, who joined the group almost nine years ago, has been looking for ways to bolster returns for investors and galvanize the stock, which has sunk more than 15 per cent in the past year.\n\n\"We're not happy with the share price at all,\" Winters said on Bloomberg Television. The market has \"a sense that it's hard to get things done at Standard Chartered and this Fit for Growth program is going to tackle that head on.\"\n\nFinal dividend\n\nStandard Chartered's adjusted pretax profit rose 63 per cent to $1.06 billion in the three months through December, beating an estimate of $989.6 million.\n\nThe lender declared a final dividend of 21 cents a share, raising the full-year payout by 50 per cent. It unveiled new guidance, targeting a 12 per cent return on tangible equity in 2026 and a 5 to 7 per cent growth in operating income for 2024 to 2026.\n\nShares jumped as much as 6.9 per cent in early London trading on Friday.\n\nOptions\n\nDespite its exposure to some of the world's fastest growing markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, Standard Chartered shares have performed poorly in recent months and are almost 40 per cent below the level they were when Winters joined the bank in June 2015.\n\nThe bank is weighing restructuring its institutional banking arm, the unit that houses the firm's investment bankers and traders, Bloomberg News reported earlier. Options include separating its investment bank from its corporate and commercial banking operations, according to people familiar with the matter. The move could lead to job cuts and is one of several possibilities being weighed with no final decisions made yet, the people said, asking not to be identified discussing matters still under consideration.\n\n\"We've taken very material provisions there, well ahead of our peers who have investments in Chinese banks,\" Winters told reporters on a media call.",

            "text": "Central Depository Services (India) Ltd (CDSL) share price slumped over 6% on Wednesday's session, following reports that Standard Chartered Bank intends to exit its investment by selling its entire ownership through a block deal. A term sheet that Mint examined indicated that the bank will sell 7.5 million shares, or 7.18% of its holdings in CDSL. CDSL share price today opened at \u20b91,718.55 apiece on NSE.\n\nIt is projected that the deal will be worth up to $151 million in total. The shares are being sold by Standard Chartered at a floor price of \u20b91,672 apiece, which represents a 6.5% discount from CDSL's Tuesday closing price of \u20b91,788.90 on the NSE.\n\nAlso Read: Buy or sell stock: Reliance Power share price takes a pause after 35% rise in eight days\n\n\"Exciting news!

We have seen the spurt in volume with the stake sale happening at the opening. As of now, the momentum is weak but the overall trend is positive. Any dip further towards \u20b91,600\u20131,550 would be an excellent opportunity to buy in the near term, whereas 1800 is immediate resistance.\n\nAccording to news reports, around 1 crore shares, or 9.6% stake in CDSL worth \u20b91,712.9 crore, changed hands.\n\nAlso Read: ABB India shares surge 6.60% to hit new all-time high after UBS lifts target price\n\nThe Standard Chartered selling process is reportedly being handled by JP Morgan India Private Limited. A CDSL representative did not immediately respond to an email, according to mint.\n\nAs to a JM Financial research report dated February 7, CDSL benefits from India's great economic potential and stable political and macroeconomic climate, which puts the country's capital markets in a good growth position. \"However, we believe the stock remains fairly valued at current valuations of 44x/40x FY25/26E P/E,\" the research report stated.\n\nAlso Read: Sensex Today | Share Market Live Updates: Sensex up 350pts, Nifty above 22,100; O&G, Bank, Auto, FS gain, FMCG, IT muted\n\nDisclaimer: The views and recommendations above are those of individual analysts, experts and broking companies, not of Mint.

            "text": "Standard Chartered on Thursday said its pre-tax profit dropped 33% in the third quarter ended September 30, due to a nearly $1 billion combined hit from its exposure to China's real estate and banking sectors.\n\nThe Asia-focused British bank reported a $700 million impairment from its stake in China Bohai Bank, and a $186 million charge from Chinese commercial real estate.\n\nShares of Standard Chartered tumbled as much as 12% in London, the biggest intraday loss since August 2012.\n\nThe UK-headquartered bank reported July-September statutory pretax profit at $633 million, as compared with $996 million a year earlier.\n\nIts income rose 6% at $4.4 billion on rising global interest rates.\n\nStanChart said that the hit on its 16% stake in China Bohai, in which it invested more than a decade ago, was due to lower forecast interest rates and decreased lending margins.\n\nAt the end of September, StanChart's Chinese real estate exposure totalled at $2.7 billion, down $200 million from the previous quarter.\n\nChina Bohai Bank had reported a 17.8% fall in January-June net interest income, leading to a nearly 7% fall in its overall profit.\n\n\u201cWe took a couple of impairment charges a year and a bit ago, and we have taken the extra impairment charge as you can see today,\" said Standard Chartered chief financial officer (CFO) Andy Halford.\n\n\u201cThat is reflective of the fact that particularly its own net interest margin has been weaker,\" he added.\n\nThe bank also said that it is confident of hitting its return-on-tangible-equity targets of 10% this year and 11% in 2024. Its net interest margin will now approach 1.7 percentage points rather than be around that level.\n\nIncome from transaction banking - the bulk in cash management services \u2013 rose 42% and retail products grew 17%.\n\nFor the financial markets trading business, income dropped 8%.\n\nStandard Chartered is planning to hand back more than $5 billion to investors and in July had announced a $1 billion buyback.\n\nMilestone Alert!
