            "text": "KARACHI: The equities market turned in a robust performance in the first outgoing week of the new calendar year thanks to positive developments on the economic front.\n\nArif Habib Ltd said the stock market displayed notable resilience, experiencing a significant surge of 2,211 points on Monday, recording the second-highest absolute point increase and marking the highest surge on the first working day of a new year.\n\nMoreover, positive economic indicators were evident as the Federal Board of Revenue achieved a historic one-month tax collection of Rs984bn, coupled with a substantial 40.1 per cent year-on-year reduction in the trade deficit for December 2023. However, an elevated level of headline inflation number of December at 29.7pc year-on-year raised some investor concerns.\n\nOn a positive note, the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s reserves reached $8.2bn, the highest level since July 14, 2023. Moreover, the rupee strengthened by 0.16pc against the US dollar, clocking in at Rs281.4.\n\nHence, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,515 points after gaining 2,064 points or 3.3pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise positive contributions came from oil and gas exploration companies (587 points), commercial banks (392 points), fertiliser (315 points), cement (185 points), and power generation and distribution (166 points). Sectors that contributed negatively were miscellaneous (13 points), glass & ceramics (3.2 points), investment banks (1.3 points), modarbas (one point) and leasing companies (0.1 points).\n\nScrip-wise positive contributors were Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (268 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (258 points), Fauji Fertiliser Company (151 points), Hub Power Company Ltd (120 points), and United Bank Ltd (102 points). Meanwhile, scrip-wise negative contributions came from Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans Ltd (12 points), Askari Bank Ltd (6 points), Ghani Glass Ltd (4.8 points), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (4.5 points), and BankIslami Pakistan Ltd (3.6 points).\n\nForeign selling clocked in at $3.1m compared to $1.9m in the preceding week. Major selling was witnessed in exploration and production ($1.95m) and banks ($1m).\n\nOn the local front, buying was reported by other organisations ($5.5m) and banks ($5.4m). Average daily volume arrived at 687m shares, up by 5.4pc week-on-week. The average daily value settled at $69.6m, up by 11.6pc from the preceding week.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd observed that the surge in the benchmark KSE 100-share can largely be attributed to aggressive institutional buying after the IMF announced its executive board is meeting on Jan 11 to approve $700m tranche for Pakistan.\n\nGoing forward, AKD Securities Ltd said the market is anticipated to maintain its bullish momentum, fuelled by the disbursement of the IMF second tranche. The forthcoming elections will be closely watched, and uncertainty surrounding their outcome could potentially hinder the market\u2019s bullish trend.\n\nHowever, a peaceful resolution could provide a significant boost to investor confidence. Our recommendation to investors is to maintain long-term positions in companies with strong fundamentals while tactfully managing any fundamentally weak entities through a timely profit-taking strategy.\n\nAdditionally, companies offering robust dividend yields, especially in the banking, energy, and fertiliser sectors, present opportunities for accumulation, noted AKD Securities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2024",

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "United Bank Limited (UBL), one of the country\u2019s largest commercial banks, posted earnings of Rs15.04 billion for the third quarter of the ongoing calendar year, up over 128% from the profit-after-tax Rs6.59 billion in the same period of the preceding year.\n\nAccording to a notice sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Wednesday, earnings per share clocked in at Rs12.04 for the three-month period.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the bank also announced an interim cash dividend at Rs11 per share i.e. 110%. This is in addition to the interim dividend already paid at Rs22 per share i.e. 220%.\n\n\u201cThis outstanding performance was primarily fueled by higher net interest income and provisioning reversals,\u201d said Arif Habib Limited (AHL) in a note.\n\n\u201cFurthermore, UBL\u2019s unprecedented dividend payout in 9MCY23 solidified its position as the leader in dividend payments within the banking sector,\u201d it added.\n\nThe net mark-up/return jumped from Rs28.92 billion in 3QCY22 to Rs39.56 billion in 3QCY23, a significant increase of nearly 37%.\n\nThe fee and commission income earned by the bank in 3QCY23 amounted to Rs4.89 billion, an increase of 14% against Rs4.29 billion earned in the same period last year.\n\nHowever, the foreign exchange income of the firm showed a decline of over 31% down from Rs3.03 billion in 3QCY22 to Rs2.31 billion in 3QCY23.\n\nMeanwhile, the bank sustained massive net losses on securities to the tune of Rs7.84 billion in 3QCY23, in comparison to a gain of Rs109.48 million in SPLY.\n\nUBL\u2019s dividend income remained largely stable, with a 1% increase YoY.\n\nDuring 3QCY23, operating expenses of the firm amounted to Rs18.58 billion, up 29% against Rs14.44 billion in SPLY.\n\nThe firm reported a sharp hike in expenditure on worker welfare funds which increased by over 52% during the period.

            "text": "Faysal Bank Limited (PSX: FABL) announced on Thursday to set up a fully-owned exchange company with an initial capital injection of Rs 1 billion.\n\nThis move aligns with the provisions outlined in Sections 96 and 131 of the Securities Act, 2015, and Regulation 5.6.1 of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) Rule Book.\n\nDuring a board meeting held on September 27, 2023, Faysal Bank Limited\u2019s board of directors approved the establishment of an exchange company, starting with an initial paid-up capital of Rs 1 billion, pending clearance and approval from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), bank\u2019s filing in the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) said.\n\nThis development follows recent efforts to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP has pledged to institute structural reforms in the exchange company sector, emphasizing the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe primary aim of this crackdown is to enhance oversight of the open market and strengthen governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures within the sector. The minimum capital requirement for exchange companies has been raised from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional requirement that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that Faysal Bank Limited joins the ranks of major banks keen on participating in this transformative shift. United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), and Allied Bank Limited (ABL) have all recently indicated their intentions to establish their own forex companies.\n\nHabib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had already ventured into exchange companies before the introduction of these new regulatory measures by the SBP.",

            "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) suspended the trading of multiple companies on regulatory non-compliance, ranging from non-payment of dues to not holding annual general meetings to non-submission of the annual audited financial statements.\n\nAccording to notices issued on January 12, these companies failed to comply with the regulatory clause(s) 5.11.1 of PSX regulation that falls under the heading of defaulters\u2019 segment, suspension and de-listing.\n\nMohammad Farooq Textile, Gulistan Textile, Haydari Construction, Huffaz Seamless Pipe Industries and Silver Star Insurance got shares trading suspension due to reasons, including failing to hold the annual general meeting and non-submission of the annual audited financial statements.\n\nClause 5.11.1 (c) of the PSX regulations suggests that a company should hold its one annual general meeting as per law, and clause 5.11.1 (d) suggests that a company should submit its annual audited accounts for the preceding financial year.\n\nAs per PSX notice, Saudi Pak Leasing Company was stopped from trading because it suspended commercial production/business operations in its principal line of business for a continuous period of one year. It also violated rules regarding payment of dues of the exchange. SECP cancelled its Non-Banking Finance Company (NBFC) and issued a show cause notice initiating a Winding-up proceeding.\n\nSimilarly, Progressive Insurance Company was also suspended from trading due to non-payment of dues, suspension of commercial business, and a winding-up petition filed by the SECP.\n\nZahur Cotton Mills got a suspension of shares because it suspended commercial production/business operations in its principal line of business and non-induction of its Ordinary Shares into the Central Depository System (CDS).\n\nThe PSX took the decision to suspend shares trading in the exercise of the powers vested in the Exchange under Sub-Section (7) of Section 19 of the Securities Act, 2015 and clause 5.11 of the PSX Regulations.\n\nAdditionally, United Bank Limited announced the dates of Book Closure from January 21, 2024, to January 28, 2024, for the 20th profit payment of their Term Finance Certificate (TFC).\n\nGiven the above, trading in the said TFC will be suspended from January 19, 2024, to January 28, 2024, and will resume on January 29, 2024.",

What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nIn a related development, the SBP issued the no-objection certificate (NOC) to Allied Bank Limited and MCB Bank Limited for establishing their exchange companies. Allied Bank\u2019s exchange company will be named ABL Exchange Company (Private) Limited and MCB\u2019s as MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited.\n\nThis move is part of a broader effort to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP is implementing structural reforms in the exchange company sector to strengthen oversight, governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures.\n\nThe SBP has also increased the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the added condition that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nAskari Bank Limited joins several major banks, including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), Bank Alfalah (BAFL) and Habib Metropolitan Bank in their pursuit to establish their own forex companies.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",
