            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has sought clarification from 19 companies to explain the unusual movements in their share prices and volumes. The PSX issued notices to these companies on December 20, 2023, seeking clarification on this unexpected fluctuation.\n\nAccording to the PSX data, the share prices and volumes of these companies showed significant variations between November 16, 2023 and December 15, 2023.\n\nAmong the companies that have received notices from the PSX are two banks, namely The Bank of Punjab and Samba Bank Limited.\n\nOther firms that are also under scrutiny include First Punjab Modaraba, Unicap Modaraba, Sapphire Fibres Limited, Reliance Insurance Company Limited, Pakistan National Shipping Corporation Limited, Pak-Gulf Leasing Company Limited, Pak Elektron Limited, Otsuka Pakistan Limited, The National Silk & Rayon Mills Limited, K-Electric Limited, Universal Network Systems Limited, First Treet Manufacturing Modaraba, First Habib Modaraba, Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited, First Elite Capital Modaraba, Chakwal Spinning Mills Limited, and Agritech Limited.\n\nThe PSX has requested these companies to provide any material or price-sensitive information that is likely to affect the price of their shares if it is not already available to the public as stipulated under the PSX Regulation.\n\nThe stock exchange stated that this development underscores the vigilance and regulatory oversight exercised by the PSX aimed at ensuring that all market participants operate within a framework defined by transparency and integrity.\n\nThe market analysts are speculating that the unusual movement in the share prices and volumes of these companies could be due to the rumors of possible mergers, acquisitions, expansions, or other strategic decisions by these companies or their competitors.\n\nThe PSX has warned that if any of the companies fail to comply with the PSX Regulation, they may face disciplinary action as per the PSX Rules.\n\nFollowing the PSX letter, Sapphire Fibres Limited, Samba Bank, Pakistan National Shipping Corporation, GEMUNSL, First Punjab Modaraba and Agritech Limited said on December 21 that they did not know of any cause/ significant information that could have led to the abnormal change in market price or volume during the specified time period.",

            "text": "More than 1/4th of the total market capitalisation of companies listed at the Pakistan Stock Exchange was added in three months \u2014 September, October, and November 2023.\n\nSince then, for the last two months, the KSE-100 index has been within range, with the lowest at 59,170 and the highest at 66,426, as the market awaited clarity expected after the elections.\n\nBut the election results have only increased the uncertainty, as no single party won a majority, reflected in a deep negative opening on the first few days after the market opened on February 9.\n\nThis leads to the question as to what the future trend in the market could be. For this we need to evaluate what has led to gains in the past few months and the trend in the stocks\u2019 performance.\n\nNew govt will have to introduce long-term financing plan: Moody\u2019s\n\nMost of the high gaining stocks (excluding dividends) since September 1, 2023, when the market started rising, are from the following sectors: (prices of February 7, 2024 / August 31, 2023)\n\nAutomobile assembler (PSMC up:494%, SAZEW up:224%)\n\nTransport (PIAA up:195%, PNSC up:136%)\n\nTechnology and communication (Airlink up:176%, PTC up:94%)\n\nPower generation and distribution (KEL up:147%, LPL up:61%)\n\nSugar and allied industries (SHSML up:140%, HABSM up:92%)\n\nRefinery (PRL up:107%)\n\nFertilizer (FFBL up:100%, EFERT up:62%)\n\nOil and gas exploration companies (PPL up:77%, OGDC up:56%)\n\nCommercial banking (BOP up:77%, JSBL up:74%)\n\nSome of these stocks, which are also constituents of the KSE-100, had major contributions in the 19,000-point increase in the index from September 1, 2023 to February 7, 2024. Only the top 5 stocks added 5,700 points to the index during this period; OGDC: 1,300 points, PPL: 1,200 points, HUBC: 1,200 points, EFERT:1,100 points, UBL: 900 points (approx.)\n\nThroughout CY23, companies and foreign corporates were the major buyers and they continued to remain so during the last few months, however, major shift in the sentiment of insurance companies in the first half of August 2023, becoming net buyers from net sellers, fueled the upside movement in the market.\n\nMoody\u2019s says timely election result to reduce uncertainty in Pakistan: report\n\nBesides macro-economic factors, the positive sentiment in the market was built by multiple company specific factors, including significant dividend payouts and major buy-back announcements by large size companies, delisting of an automobile company, improved pricing of gas for its impact on circular debt, approval of refinery policy, progress on privatisation and expectation of resolution of circular debt through dividends.\n\nSome of these factors influencing market sentiment will depend on the policy of the new government coming into power, while others are not directly related, which would keep those gains sticky.\n\nThe economic challenges ahead require a government that can continue reforms, including the completion of the second review under the stand-by arrangement of IMF by March 15, 2024 and successful negotiation of a new IMF program.\n\nThe ability of a coalition government to take timely and challenging decisions, especially when different parties make governments in provinces and center, will remain to be a subject matter.\n\nThe current base of the market is driven mostly by a wide range of reasons and improved performance of companies, however, the investors will remain cautious in setting the future direction, until clarity.\n\nThe article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Business Recorder or its owners",

            "text": "The banking sector in Pakistan maintained robust growth in profitability during 2023, including growth in assets and deposits, the high-interest rate regime allowed them to make handsome margins, increase investment in securities, and lend cash to the federal government at exorbitant financing rates.\n\nOn the other hand, they attracted deposits from customers, providing them with handsome returns too. There have also been major transformations and developments in a few commercial banks, which will impact the banking sector positively in the long term.\n\nALSO READ Bank Alfalah Launches Pakistan\u2019s First Digital Payments Sales and Service Centers Focusing on Merchants and Small Businesses\n\nSome of the initiatives taken by different commercial banks will be followed by other competing banks in the near future. Below are a few major developments that happened during 2023:\n\n(1) Faysal Bank\u2019s Conversion to Islamic Bank\n\nFaysal Bank announced its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank on the first day of the calendar year. The bank converted its assets, deposits, operations, branches, and licenses from conventional to Sharia-based banks and became the second-biggest Islamic bank in the banking industry.\n\nThis transition is said to be the biggest conversion of any conventional bank, not only in Pakistan but in the world, considering the size of the operation. The transformation of Faysal Bank also provided a roadmap for other banks seeking to convert their operations from conventional to Islamic.\n\n(2) MCB Bank Acquires 81% Stake in Asset Management Company\n\nMCB Bank acquired an additional 30 percent stake in its subsidiary, MCBAH Savings and Investments, at the cost of Rs. 649 million. Through this deal, the bank received 21.6 million shares, or 30 percent, of another sponsor, Arif Habib Corporation, at a share price of Rs. 30. Hence, its overall shareholding in the subsidiary increased to over 81 percent from 51 percent.\n\nMCB-AH Limited is one of the leading asset management companies in the fund management sector, and a few companies within a sector are also listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The transition in shareholding will strengthen the position of the bank in the financial sector.\n\n(3) JS Bank Acquires Major Shareholding in BankIslami\n\nJS Bank Acquired major shares in BankIslami to convert the Islamic bank into its subsidiary with ownership of the significant shareholding. The bank increased its stakes in the Islamic bank by 75 percent by purchasing shares from the parent financial entity, JS Group.\n\nThe share swap deal was successful between the sponsors of the Islamic bank, despite being challenged in the Sindh High Court. JS Bank maintained a different strategic position, which will increase its profitability and influence in the banking industry after this deal.\n\n(4) Prominent Banks Plan for Conversion to Islamic Banking\n\nProminent conventional banks with a separate division of Islamic banking announced their plans for full-fledged conversion to Islamic Banking in light of a verdict issued by the Federal Shariat Court last year.\n\nThe banks included the Bank of Punjab, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, and Summit Bank. In this regard, the Bank of Punjab hired a consultant, and Summit Bank rebranded itself as Mukramah Bank. This transition in banking operations will likely attract different conventional banks to follow the same suit.\n\nALSO READ Financial Irregularities Worth Rs.14 Billion Allegedly Uncovered During PSL Audit\n\n(5) Bank Alfalah Acquires Stakes in QistBazaar\n\nBank Alfalah acquired 7.2 percent stakes in BNPL QistBazaar at a cost of Rs. 140 million. The deal can be a win-win situation for both entities in scaling up their business and profitability.\n\nIn addition to the equity agreement, Bank Alfalah, and QistBazaar signed an embedded financing agreement in Shariah-compliant mode for up to Rs. 350 million. Accordingly, the bank will incorporate digital financing products within the QistBazaar platform to offer embedded consumer durables financing in BNPL\u2019s mode.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s move to invest in QistBazaar can prove a stepping stone to strengthening the fintech landscape of the country, as more banks are likely to follow suit for collaboration and investment in fintech companies, which is the need of the hour.\n\n(6) Major Banks to Set up Exchange Companies\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) plans to streamline the business of foreign exchange across the country with control and regulation on trade and flows of foreign currencies, mainly to monitor the stability of the rupee against the dollar. In this regard, the banking industry watched as various exchange companies in Category B shut down while commercial banks were allowed to establish their foreign exchange subsidiaries as an alternate option in the financial sector.\n\nAn overwhelming number of banks made announcements to set up subsidiaries of foreign exchange, including HBL, UBL, MCB, Bank Al Habib, Meezan Bank, Habib Metro Bank, Askari Bank, etc.\n\n(7) Summit Bank Receives Investment from UAE\n\nSummit Bank received a significant capital injection of Rs. 10 billion from its sponsor and prominent UAE investor, Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah.\n\nThe investor subscribed to 3.98 billion new shares of the bank at Rs. 2.51 per share, becoming the major shareholder in the bank. Moreover, Summit Bank plans to convert its entire operation from a conventional banking system to an Islamic one, similar to Faysal Bank. Its board of directors also approved a three-year conversion plan, and the bank has been renamed Bank Makramah Limited\n\n(8) Silk Bank Attracts Investors\n\nSilk Bank, once again, sought the financial support of a strong investor on a long-term basis to fulfill its regulatory requirements of paid-up capital and the sustainability of its profitable operations.\n\nThe bank has attracted interest from MCB Bank, United Bank Limited, International Commercial Bank of South Sudan, and Pakistan Housing Finance Company for investment and merger. At present, these financial institutions are carrying out the due diligence of the bank, which is showing the increasing competition among these entities in striking a deal with Silk Bank.\n\nSudanese Bank and Pakistan Housing Company even expressed their investment plans of 50 million euros and Rs. 12 billion, respectively. With four proposals in hand, it is a good time for Silk Bank to say yes to at least one institution with remarkable experience in local industry and operating a subsidiary.\n\nALSO READ State Bank Fails to Satisfy Panel in Rs. 70 Billion Money Laundering Scandal\n\n(9) Meezan Bank Collaborates to Launch Islamic Microfinance Services\n\nMeezan Bank took the initiative to collaborate with SAFCO Microfinance Company Private Limited (SMCL) for the launch of Islamic microfinance services in the low-income segment of society.\n\nThis is the first time that a commercial bank has significantly supported a microfinance institution. The leading Islamic bank has committed to providing Rs. 100 million in financing and technical support for product development, capacity building, and training for the microfinance company.\n\nThe step will further accelerate the penetration of Islamic banking across the country. The microfinance company established its inaugural Islamic microfinance branch under the brand name \u2018Yaqeen\u2019 in Hyderabad, Pakistan.\n\n(10) HBL to Set Up a Specialized Agri Subsidiary\n\nHabib Bank Limited received approval from the State Bank of Pakistan to set up a specialized subsidiary for the agriculture sector. The subsidiary will work to provide financial access to farmers and other players in the agriculture sector, particularly, but the institution has plans to be deeply involved in the sector\u2019s development.\n\nThe leading bank previously carried out different projects successfully in this sector, which gave it the confidence to enhance its footprints in the food sector with a much bigger role and a long-term profitable engagement. The out-of-box approach of the bank\u2019s leadership might give it a competitive edge in the industry.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Pakistan market (PSX) saw just one IPO in 2023, with a meagre Rs 435 million of funds raised.\n\nThis was the lowest amount raised in a year in the past decade and half of the previous record low of Rs 800 million seen in 2013.\n\nIn terms of number of IPOs, PSX has yet again seen a single IPO after 2019. This is in sharp contrast to the previous 5 year and 10 year average of 4 IPO\u2019s/year.\n\n\u201cWe attribute this bad IPO trend to macro-economic instability, coupled with the looming threat of default, cheap valuations and political uncertainty discouraging equity investment,\u201d Muhammad Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities said.\n\nThe single IPO that the PSX saw this year was of Symmetry Group (SYM) on the main board.\n\nThis is Pakistan\u2019s first publicly listed digital technology company with focus on digitalization of consumer-centric functions of organizations.\n\nThe company offered 101.24 million shares at strike price of Rs 4.3/share, raising Rs 435 million in August 2023 with an over-subscription of 1.58x.\n\nGlobally, a similar trend has also been seen where IPOs have dried-up.\n\nAs per Ernst & Young (E&Y), a total of 968 IPOs were witnessed till the first nine months of 2023 raising $101 billion compared to 1,018 IPOs raising $148 billion in same period last year.\n\nThis is attributed to rising macro challenges, tighter liquidity, and higher cost of capital.\n\nThe benchmark KSE-100 index in the first half of 2023 was up by only 3.0 percent in PKR while down 19 percent in US$ with average daily traded volume of 163 million shares and average daily traded value of Rs 6.0 billion.\n\nHowever in the second half of 2023 to date, the KSE-100 index witnessed sharp recovery and is up by 51 percent in PKR and 52 percent in US$ with average daily traded volume in cash/ready market improved to 377 million shares and Rs 12 billion.\n\nWe believe, this positive sentiment if maintained, is likely to be capitalized by companies wishing to access external capital; which will lead to an uptick in companies applying to be listed at the PSX in 2024.\n\nA new shorter IPO process has recently been introduced in Pakistan, where 14 working day limit has been placed for granting of regulatory approval to listing application and prospectus by SECP, coupled with a 15 day limit on PSX for post-approval procedure for listing.\n\n\u201cWe believe this standardization will also help in more companies raising funds through IPO in 2024.\u201d\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2023",

            "text": "Meezan Bank, the country\u2019s largest Islamic bank, posted earnings of Rs25.99 billion for the first three months of fiscal 2023-24, up nearly 124% from the profit-after-tax Rs11.62 billion in the same period of the preceding year.\n\nAccording to a notice sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday, earnings per share clocked in at Rs14.42 for the three-month period.\n\nThe Board of Directors also announced an interim cash dividend for the quarter ended September 30, 2023 at Rs5 per share i.e. 50%.
