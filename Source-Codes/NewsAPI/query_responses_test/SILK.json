            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has sought clarification from 19 companies to explain the unusual movements in their share prices and volumes. The PSX issued notices to these companies on December 20, 2023, seeking clarification on this unexpected fluctuation.\n\nAccording to the PSX data, the share prices and volumes of these companies showed significant variations between November 16, 2023 and December 15, 2023.\n\nAmong the companies that have received notices from the PSX are two banks, namely The Bank of Punjab and Samba Bank Limited.\n\nOther firms that are also under scrutiny include First Punjab Modaraba, Unicap Modaraba, Sapphire Fibres Limited, Reliance Insurance Company Limited, Pakistan National Shipping Corporation Limited, Pak-Gulf Leasing Company Limited, Pak Elektron Limited, Otsuka Pakistan Limited, The National Silk & Rayon Mills Limited, K-Electric Limited, Universal Network Systems Limited, First Treet Manufacturing Modaraba, First Habib Modaraba, Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited, First Elite Capital Modaraba, Chakwal Spinning Mills Limited, and Agritech Limited.\n\nThe PSX has requested these companies to provide any material or price-sensitive information that is likely to affect the price of their shares if it is not already available to the public as stipulated under the PSX Regulation.\n\nThe stock exchange stated that this development underscores the vigilance and regulatory oversight exercised by the PSX aimed at ensuring that all market participants operate within a framework defined by transparency and integrity.\n\nThe market analysts are speculating that the unusual movement in the share prices and volumes of these companies could be due to the rumors of possible mergers, acquisitions, expansions, or other strategic decisions by these companies or their competitors.\n\nThe PSX has warned that if any of the companies fail to comply with the PSX Regulation, they may face disciplinary action as per the PSX Rules.\n\nFollowing the PSX letter, Sapphire Fibres Limited, Samba Bank, Pakistan National Shipping Corporation, GEMUNSL, First Punjab Modaraba and Agritech Limited said on December 21 that they did not know of any cause/ significant information that could have led to the abnormal change in market price or volume during the specified time period.",

            "short_description": "Here's What Happened in Pakistan's Banking Sector in 2023  ProPakistani",
            "text": "The banking sector in Pakistan maintained robust growth in profitability during 2023, including growth in assets and deposits, the high-interest rate regime allowed them to make handsome margins, increase investment in securities, and lend cash to the federal government at exorbitant financing rates.\n\nOn the other hand, they attracted deposits from customers, providing them with handsome returns too. There have also been major transformations and developments in a few commercial banks, which will impact the banking sector positively in the long term.\n\nALSO READ Bank Alfalah Launches Pakistan\u2019s First Digital Payments Sales and Service Centers Focusing on Merchants and Small Businesses\n\nSome of the initiatives taken by different commercial banks will be followed by other competing banks in the near future. Below are a few major developments that happened during 2023:\n\n(1) Faysal Bank\u2019s Conversion to Islamic Bank\n\nFaysal Bank announced its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank on the first day of the calendar year. The bank converted its assets, deposits, operations, branches, and licenses from conventional to Sharia-based banks and became the second-biggest Islamic bank in the banking industry.\n\nThis transition is said to be the biggest conversion of any conventional bank, not only in Pakistan but in the world, considering the size of the operation. The transformation of Faysal Bank also provided a roadmap for other banks seeking to convert their operations from conventional to Islamic.\n\n(2) MCB Bank Acquires 81% Stake in Asset Management Company\n\nMCB Bank acquired an additional 30 percent stake in its subsidiary, MCBAH Savings and Investments, at the cost of Rs. 649 million. Through this deal, the bank received 21.6 million shares, or 30 percent, of another sponsor, Arif Habib Corporation, at a share price of Rs. 30. Hence, its overall shareholding in the subsidiary increased to over 81 percent from 51 percent.\n\nMCB-AH Limited is one of the leading asset management companies in the fund management sector, and a few companies within a sector are also listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The transition in shareholding will strengthen the position of the bank in the financial sector.\n\n(3) JS Bank Acquires Major Shareholding in BankIslami\n\nJS Bank Acquired major shares in BankIslami to convert the Islamic bank into its subsidiary with ownership of the significant shareholding. The bank increased its stakes in the Islamic bank by 75 percent by purchasing shares from the parent financial entity, JS Group.\n\nThe share swap deal was successful between the sponsors of the Islamic bank, despite being challenged in the Sindh High Court. JS Bank maintained a different strategic position, which will increase its profitability and influence in the banking industry after this deal.\n\n(4) Prominent Banks Plan for Conversion to Islamic Banking\n\nProminent conventional banks with a separate division of Islamic banking announced their plans for full-fledged conversion to Islamic Banking in light of a verdict issued by the Federal Shariat Court last year.\n\nThe banks included the Bank of Punjab, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, and Summit Bank. In this regard, the Bank of Punjab hired a consultant, and Summit Bank rebranded itself as Mukramah Bank. This transition in banking operations will likely attract different conventional banks to follow the same suit.\n\nALSO READ Financial Irregularities Worth Rs.14 Billion Allegedly Uncovered During PSL Audit\n\n(5) Bank Alfalah Acquires Stakes in QistBazaar\n\nBank Alfalah acquired 7.2 percent stakes in BNPL QistBazaar at a cost of Rs. 140 million. The deal can be a win-win situation for both entities in scaling up their business and profitability.\n\nIn addition to the equity agreement, Bank Alfalah, and QistBazaar signed an embedded financing agreement in Shariah-compliant mode for up to Rs. 350 million. Accordingly, the bank will incorporate digital financing products within the QistBazaar platform to offer embedded consumer durables financing in BNPL\u2019s mode.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s move to invest in QistBazaar can prove a stepping stone to strengthening the fintech landscape of the country, as more banks are likely to follow suit for collaboration and investment in fintech companies, which is the need of the hour.\n\n(6) Major Banks to Set up Exchange Companies\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) plans to streamline the business of foreign exchange across the country with control and regulation on trade and flows of foreign currencies, mainly to monitor the stability of the rupee against the dollar. In this regard, the banking industry watched as various exchange companies in Category B shut down while commercial banks were allowed to establish their foreign exchange subsidiaries as an alternate option in the financial sector.\n\nAn overwhelming number of banks made announcements to set up subsidiaries of foreign exchange, including HBL, UBL, MCB, Bank Al Habib, Meezan Bank, Habib Metro Bank, Askari Bank, etc.\n\n(7) Summit Bank Receives Investment from UAE\n\nSummit Bank received a significant capital injection of Rs. 10 billion from its sponsor and prominent UAE investor, Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah.\n\nThe investor subscribed to 3.98 billion new shares of the bank at Rs. 2.51 per share, becoming the major shareholder in the bank. Moreover, Summit Bank plans to convert its entire operation from a conventional banking system to an Islamic one, similar to Faysal Bank. Its board of directors also approved a three-year conversion plan, and the bank has been renamed Bank Makramah Limited\n\n(8) Silk Bank Attracts Investors\n\nSilk Bank, once again, sought the financial support of a strong investor on a long-term basis to fulfill its regulatory requirements of paid-up capital and the sustainability of its profitable operations.\n\nThe bank has attracted interest from MCB Bank, United Bank Limited, International Commercial Bank of South Sudan, and Pakistan Housing Finance Company for investment and merger. At present, these financial institutions are carrying out the due diligence of the bank, which is showing the increasing competition among these entities in striking a deal with Silk Bank.\n\nSudanese Bank and Pakistan Housing Company even expressed their investment plans of 50 million euros and Rs. 12 billion, respectively. With four proposals in hand, it is a good time for Silk Bank to say yes to at least one institution with remarkable experience in local industry and operating a subsidiary.\n\nALSO READ State Bank Fails to Satisfy Panel in Rs. 70 Billion Money Laundering Scandal\n\n(9) Meezan Bank Collaborates to Launch Islamic Microfinance Services\n\nMeezan Bank took the initiative to collaborate with SAFCO Microfinance Company Private Limited (SMCL) for the launch of Islamic microfinance services in the low-income segment of society.\n\nThis is the first time that a commercial bank has significantly supported a microfinance institution. The leading Islamic bank has committed to providing Rs. 100 million in financing and technical support for product development, capacity building, and training for the microfinance company.\n\nThe step will further accelerate the penetration of Islamic banking across the country. The microfinance company established its inaugural Islamic microfinance branch under the brand name \u2018Yaqeen\u2019 in Hyderabad, Pakistan.\n\n(10) HBL to Set Up a Specialized Agri Subsidiary\n\nHabib Bank Limited received approval from the State Bank of Pakistan to set up a specialized subsidiary for the agriculture sector. The subsidiary will work to provide financial access to farmers and other players in the agriculture sector, particularly, but the institution has plans to be deeply involved in the sector\u2019s development.\n\nThe leading bank previously carried out different projects successfully in this sector, which gave it the confidence to enhance its footprints in the food sector with a much bigger role and a long-term profitable engagement. The out-of-box approach of the bank\u2019s leadership might give it a competitive edge in the industry.",

            "short_description": "Ten years ago Chenab Limited defaulted on its loans. Now it looks towards second act  Profit by Pakistan Today",
            "text": "This is the story of a rise, a fall, and possibly a second act. Over the past fifteen years the Chenab Group has faced a gamut of challenges. Once one of the largest exporters in Pakistan, and owner of the popular ChenOne stores locally, they faced consistent losses as the country\u2019s textile industry suffered in the aftermath of the 2008 energy and financial crises.\n\nMany waited and watched to see when Chenab and its owner, Mian Muhammad Latif, would call it quits. However, either completely through an act of inertia or through sheer determination, somehow the vertically integrated textile exporter clung on. And now an opportunity may just have presented itself from unlikely quarters.\n\nThe company has been given some quarter to breathe thanks to its lenders. Amongst them, HBL was Chenab\u2019s biggest lender. And now the bank is spearheading the restructuring of the company\u2019s Rs 10 billion overdue debt to the banking sector.\n\nThere seems to be belief within HBL that the Chenab Group will succeed in turning their company around. Where does this faith come from? It might have something to do with the company\u2019s origins and its history.\n\nBig dreams\n\nWe start off in Toba Tek Singh. With a young man and a big dream. Mian Latif was the son of a leading cotton industrialist. Latif\u2019s family had come to Toba Tek Singh back in 1883 and were agriculturalists. In small towns like Toba Tek Singh, land-owning farmers realised cotton was an important crop for the ruling British Empire. And for much of his childhood Latif saw as his family\u2019s fortunes grew. Within the tiny agricultural community, cotton farming and ginning were lucrative businesses. Mian Latif\u2019s family were large landholders in Toba Tek Singh, a district roughly halfway between Faisalabad and Multan.\n\nBut as a young man Mian Latif\u2019s ambition lay far beyond Toba Tek Singh. In the 1970s many of Punjab\u2019s large rural land holding families were making a transition: moving their main source of wealth away from farming the cotton \u2013 and other crops, such as sugar \u2013 and towards setting up the industrial units that would process and sell finished goods. And for this purpose Mian Latif, along with three of his brothers, set his eyes on Lyallpur.\n\nThe city had still not been dubbed Faisalabad when Mian Latif first started establishing a business there in 1973. At the time the city was still developing and far from the industrial hub it is today. But Latif had a belief that his family\u2019s future lay in manufacturing textiles rather than just farming and selling cotton. Remember, the 1970s were marked by mass nationalisation. The independence of Bangladesh in 1971 also meant Pakistan lost many of its industrial units and there were no exports to speak of.\n\nLatif set about establishing a production unit which could not only manufacture but also export. The company started off by producing textile goods for the local market. In 1985 they began exporting goods starting from the Far East from where they moved to Europe and then USA, eventually exporting goods to around 42 countries.\n\nEvents leading up to the crisis\n\nTo understand the downfall of the company, it is important to understand the time leading up to the crisis. In 1999, when Gen Musharraf took power in a military coup, the Chenab Group was still a lower middle-market business in terms of size. And ChenOne at the time only had three stores, though its fourth store opened up in Karachi that year. During the Musharraf Administration, however, as the government privatised the banks and encouraged private sector lending, particularly for industrial growth projects, the Chenab Group started expanding aggressively. For the financial year ending June 30, 2001, Chenab Ltd, the group\u2019s main publicly listed company, had revenues of Rs340 crores. Over the next six years, the company more than doubled its revenue, ending the financial year 2007 with Rs816 crores in revenue, which represents an average annual growth rate of 15.7%. At one point in time, the company was making $30 million worth of exports on a monthly basis and employed 12,000 people.\n\nThat growth, however, was fueled largely by debt. In 2001, the company had just under Rs70 crores in long-term debt. By 2007, that number had ballooned to Rs332 crores, a nearly five times increase. Yet cash flows were not keeping pace: Chenab Ltd\u2019s net income in 2007 was just Rs7.5 crores, even less than the Rs13 crores it had earned in 2001.\n\nYet the group kept expanding, particularly its retail chain, which opened up more stores throughout urban Pakistan, particularly in the smaller metropolitan areas of Punjab, where it took to developing not just its own stores, but large shopping malls and complexes under the name ChenOne Tower. The first ChenOne Tower opened in 2005 in Multan, followed by another in Sargodha, which finally opened in 2009.\n\nAt the same time, even though the company was growing, stiff competition from China and India was being faced. These countries were providing subsidies to the textile industry while Pakistan had no such programme for its own industry. Not at the same scale, at least.\n\nIn domestic terms, the finance costs were already ramping up as interest rates were being used to address inflation which were also being translated to higher energy and labour costs. Even though profitability was down, it was expected that as the conditions would improve, the company would be able to rebound.\n\nThe crisis sets in\n\nThe year 2008 was supposed to be a stellar year, in terms of sales, for the company as it had already forecasted sales of more than Rs. 800 crores for the year. The company was able to earn revenues of Rs. 850 crores but it was the first year in decades that the company made a loss.\n\nThe cause for this was two events. First of all, the country started to see wide scale gas and electricity load shedding which forced production to slow down and created an added pressure on the costs being incurred. In addition to that, the assasination of Benazir Bhutto saw the whole country shut down. With railway lines and road infrastructure being impacted, exports stopped with containers waiting at the ports for days.\n\nBetween 2007-8 Pakistan was hit by the global recession. The textile industry faced challenges due to high energy costs, rupee depreciation vis-\u00e0-vis the US $ and other currencies, and a high cost of doing business. As a result, there was a reduction in the number of textile mills operating in the country from about 450 units in 2009 to 400 units in 2019. This decrease has simultaneously seen the domestic demand for cotton dip in the country.\n\nThe ethos of the company became a haunting call as the company was not able to follow through on its promise of commitment. Rising costs and fall in revenues were already having an impact on the company. However, something much more damaging was also taking place. Clients were not getting their orders and the trust that had been built bit by bit over years came crashing down in a matter of days.\n\nLatif himself explains the situation thusly. \u201cThe trust we had built with the clients is built inch by inch. When it comes down, it comes down in meters.\u201d\n\nThe loss of brand name and image for clients was going to have a devastating impact on the future revenues of the company and would have a long lasting effect. The period from 2009 to 2014 saw the company face consistent losses. The inertia built into the system saw sales of Rs. 900 crores in 2009 decline to only Rs. 220 crores by 2014.\n\nAs the losses started to accumulate, the equity of the company turned negative in 2011 and stood at minus Rs. 400 crores in 2014. In real terms, the company saw a loss of Rs. 730 crores in a span of 5 years which comes to around average annual losses of Rs 150 crores per year.\n\nThe impact of losses had a two fold impact on the company. At one hand, the company relied on taking on more debt in order to fund its working capital requirements in order to carry out some form of manufacturing. Even though orders had fallen, still the company needed to make sure it could retain some form of exports to the clients who had still stuck with the company. The company hit its lowest point when, in 2014, it announced that it would not be able to pay back its debt obligations which led to many of the creditors filing recovery proceedings against the company.\n\nAs the case proceedings started, Latif still felt that his dream should not die. Even in the darkest times, he had the belief that given the right support and resources, his dream will become reality once again.\n\nIn 2017, the Lahore High Court asked winding up proceedings to be initiated against the company in order to allow the banks to sell the assets of the company and get back some of their money. This would have felt like the end of a journey that started 43 years ago. Latif still persevered and fought. The case was litigated to the fullest extent and in 2021, the court reversed its winding up orders. The company was going to be allowed to operate once again.\n\nThe unlikely hero\n\nIn many ways Chenab is not unique. Like many of Pakistan\u2019s upper middle-market companies \u2013 the ones just on the cusp of being large but not quite \u2013 Chenab tried to grow too fast with too much debt during the easy money era of the Musharraf years, and crashed hard after the financial crisis of 2008, and has yet to recover since. Yet unlike some of the other financial carcasses of the 2008 crash, the owners of Chenab have continued to try to revive their business.\n\nIt has perhaps been that tenacity that is now paying off. After some favourable bankruptcy case rulings in the Lahore High Court (LHC) back in 2020, the company has now found an ally in HBL. At this point, there were 22 creditors who had lent to the company. Among the biggest lenders was HBL. In such dire circumstances, HBL provided an opportunity for the company to get back up on its feet.\n\nHBL spearheaded the effort to consolidate the total debt of the company and to restructure its short term borrowings to allow it to convert them all into long term liabilities. With assurances from the bank, the company felt that it could regain its lost glory and attain the heights that it once had.\n\nThe bank has also provided much needed backing to the ailing company. The Rs. 9.5 billion debt was restructured for a period of 14 years. The bank believed in the fact that once the company was given an infusion of fresh financing, it would be used to fund the working capital requirements of the company. This would allow the company to meet its current orders and any excess capacity could be used to further broaden its sales and profits.\n\nIn addition to the banks restructuring the loan, the directors of the company gave a loan of Rs. 42 crore and 50 lakhs to the company and it was decided to sell some of the non core assets of the company in order to fund the working capital requirements.\n\nThe restructuring plan\n\nBased on the court filings, Chenab Limited contested that it will execute a revival plan for the company and its competitors in order to turn the company around. The courts had already ordered winding up proceedings to be started against the company on the back of recovery lawsuits filed by some of the creditors. The Chenab Group felt that in order to put any plan into action, the first step was to get a stay on the winding up proceedings. Habib Bank, the largest creditor, joined together with some of the other creditors to provide some breathing space to the company.\n\nChenab group had short term loans of Rs. 4.3 billion while its long terms loans stood at Rs. 5.1 billion. From this, Rs. 1.7 billion was held by Habib bank followed by United bank held Rs 1.3 billion, Bank of Punjab held Rs. 1.2 billion and Askari and Allied Bank holding Rs. 1.4 billion collectively. In addition to that, the Group also owed to an additional 17 banks and financial institutions namely BankIslami, National Bank of Pakistan, Albaraka Bank, Habib Metropolitan Bank, Silkbank, Standard Chartered Bank, MCB Bank, Citibank, Faysal Bank, Saudi Pak Industrial and Agriculture Investment Company, Pak Oman Investment Company, First Punjab Modaraba, Pak Libya Holding Company, Pak Kuwait Investment Company, Orix Leasing and Orix Investment Bank, First Credit and Investment Bank and First National Bank Modaraba.\n\nThe total debt of the company was going to be divided into two parts as Tier I and Tier II with both tiers having an amount of Rs. 4.7 billion each. The Tier I loan was going to be paid over 30 quarterly installments which would elapse a time period of 7 and a half years and would start from the time the proposal was sanctioned and put into place. Once the Tier I loans were paid off, the amount owed to Tier II would be paid off over a period of 6 and a half years with 26 quarterly installments.\n\nThe markup on the loan was set at 5 percent per annum for Tier I initially while during this time the Tier II will accrue markup at 3 percent until the Tier I loan was paid off. Once this was done, the markup on the Tier II loan would also rise to 5 percent until all of it was paid off.\n\nIn addition to that, the family also sold a third of its holdings of 60% to an investor in order to meet their working capital needs at a rate of Rs. 15.2 per share. This investment totalled to around Rs. 35 crore of additional funding which was used towards the company and its restructuring. The company also committed to selling some of its non-core assets which were expected to raise Rs 1.4 billion which would be used to pay off some of its loans while also look to meet the working capital requirements of the company.\n\nLooking towards the future\n\nThe company seems to have turned the page. In the last 18 months, the company has been able to earn Rs. 2.5 billion in revenue and has hired 3,000 of its former employees back. It is a blessing for the 3,000 households whose futures and hopes are now attached with the future of the company again.\n\nFrom the total loan of Rs. 9.5 billion, the company has already paid back Rs. 1 billion and expects to keep on track of the Agreement that has been made with the banks. This mirrors Latif\u2019s words when he says that \u201cWe will give every drop of blood but will follow through on our commitment.\u201d\n\nAn important fact that needs to be mentioned here is that, even though the company has been following the payment plan that has been agreed upon, the company according to Latif is yet to reach profitability. The performance of the last 18 months has shown promise, but the company still needs some time before they turn profitable in the long run. In addition to that, the company is a listed company and was trading in the stock exchange, however, as it has not filed its annual accounts, it was delisted and put into the default counter. The company is correcting that by publishing some of its financial statements and the latest accounts that can be accessed are from 2021.",
