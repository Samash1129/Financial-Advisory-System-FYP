What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nIn a related development, the SBP issued the no-objection certificate (NOC) to Allied Bank Limited and MCB Bank Limited for establishing their exchange companies. Allied Bank\u2019s exchange company will be named ABL Exchange Company (Private) Limited and MCB\u2019s as MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited.\n\nThis move is part of a broader effort to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP is implementing structural reforms in the exchange company sector to strengthen oversight, governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures.\n\nThe SBP has also increased the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the added condition that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nAskari Bank Limited joins several major banks, including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), Bank Alfalah (BAFL) and Habib Metropolitan Bank in their pursuit to establish their own forex companies.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

Analysts have pointed out that the immediate focus remains at the 49,000-50,500 level. A break above 49,700 would instill bullishness towards 49,900 \u2013 50,000 and later 50,500 would be on the cards.\n\nConsidering the momentum, the prevalent trend warrants a cautious approach amid an overbought condition, in which case volatility in the market is likely to remain high.\n\nTop Volumes\n\nSectors painting the benchmark KSE 100 index in green included the Banking sector, the Oil & Gas Marketing Companies sector, and Technology and Communication sector. Company-wise, Meezan Bank Limited, K-Electric Limited, Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited, and Worldcall Telecom Limited were top positive contributors.\n\nSCRIP PRICE HIGH LOW CHANGE VOLUME KEL 3.16 3.18 2.84 0.28 134,866,750 PTC 7.2 7.2 6.25 0.92 48,393,000 WTL 1.34 1.37 1.3 0.04 33,562,264 PPL 81.32 81.89 76.21 3.85 15,177,099 OGDC 98.7 100.25 96.91 1.49 12,266,017 PAEL 12.49 12.88 12.2 0.55 12,112,378 SEARL 39.75 39.98 37.31 2.4 9,551,926\n\nThe Commercial Banks sector gained 3.41 percent in its cumulative market capitalization.

            "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) recorded gains of just 0.4% in the outgoing week as investors awaited the International Monetary Fund (IMF) review and monetary policy announcement next week.\n\nInvestors\u2019 interest was driven by encouraging corporate results, which triggered activity in specific stocks while some results did not meet market expectations, leading to selling pressure.\n\nContinuously depreciating rupee and a significant fall in the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) foreign currency reserves piled pressure on the bourse, which restricted the market\u2019s rapid advance.\n\nAt the beginning of the week, the PSX commenced trading on a robust note as it crossed the psychological barrier of 51,000 points owing to investor confidence aided by easing political uncertainties and positive economic data projections.\n\nHowever, the market lost momentum on Tuesday in a volatile session owing to selling pressure arising from geopolitical tensions and anxiety about the IMF\u2019s review under the $3 billion standby arrangement. On Wednesday, the bourse recovered, driven by earnings announcements and optimism about the IMF review, which would lead to the release of second loan tranche of $700 million.\n\nOn Thursday, the KSE-100 index ended nearly flat in range-bound trading as investors\u2019 spirit weakened over depreciation of Pakistani rupee and the decline in foreign currency reserves.\n\nOn the last day of the trading week, the index suffered losses as bears took the driving seat ahead of the monetary policy announcement and due to the looming uncertainty surrounding talks with the IMF.\n\nThe market closed at 50,944, up 212 points, or 0.42% week-on-week (WoW). In his market review, JS Global analyst Muhammad Waqas Ghani wrote that the KSE-100 index closed the week at 50,944, gaining 0.4% WoW. However, average volumes dropped 10% WoW to 366 million shares.\n\n\u201cAbove-expected earnings/ dividends announcement by Bank AL Habib, Fauji Cement, MCB Bank and Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans triggered activity in these stocks,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other hand, below-expected earnings and dividend announcement by Fauji Fertiliser Company impacted investors\u2019 sentiment and led to a 3.3% WoW decline in the stock\u2019s price. During the week, the auto assemblers announced 2-3% reduction in car prices to account for the recent appreciation of the rupee.\n\nOn the political front, the PML-N supremo returned to Pakistan who cited reduction in government expenditures, increase in tax revenue, rise in exports, IT sector reforms and improving relations with neighbouring countries as top issues on his party\u2019s agenda.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, as the IMF review was approaching fast, the government became more aggressive in pursuing its economic targets and implementing policy measures.\n\nOn a similar note, the ECC approved the much-awaited increase in gas prices while the budget deficit contracted to 0.9% of GDP in 1QFY24 from 1% of GDP during the same period of last year.\n\nPakistan also surpassed its primary surplus criterion set by the IMF, which was reported at 0.4% of GDP for 1QFY24, the JS analyst added. Arif Habib Limited (AHL) commented that the market kicked off trading on a positive note, driven by the approval of gas tariff hike, a significant step towards meeting one of the prerequisites for the IMF\u2019s review scheduled to commence on November 2, 2023.\n\nNotably, the current account deficit was recorded at $8 million for September 2023, down 95% month-on-month. \u201cThe momentum was further bolstered by the results season, which contributed to the positive trajectory,\u201d it said.\n\nHowever, the consistent appreciation of the rupee ended, resulting in the currency closing at Rs280.57 against the greenback, depreciating by Rs1.77, or 0.64% WoW. Moreover, SBP\u2019s reserves decreased $220 million to $7.5 billion, AHL said.\n\nForeigners turned net sellers as they sold stocks worth $3.47 million compared to net buying of $2.32 million last week, AHL added.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, October 29th, 2023.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",
