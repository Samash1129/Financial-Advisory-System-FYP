            "text": "KARACHI: The equities market turned in a robust performance in the first outgoing week of the new calendar year thanks to positive developments on the economic front.\n\nArif Habib Ltd said the stock market displayed notable resilience, experiencing a significant surge of 2,211 points on Monday, recording the second-highest absolute point increase and marking the highest surge on the first working day of a new year.\n\nMoreover, positive economic indicators were evident as the Federal Board of Revenue achieved a historic one-month tax collection of Rs984bn, coupled with a substantial 40.1 per cent year-on-year reduction in the trade deficit for December 2023. However, an elevated level of headline inflation number of December at 29.7pc year-on-year raised some investor concerns.\n\nOn a positive note, the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s reserves reached $8.2bn, the highest level since July 14, 2023. Moreover, the rupee strengthened by 0.16pc against the US dollar, clocking in at Rs281.4.\n\nHence, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,515 points after gaining 2,064 points or 3.3pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise positive contributions came from oil and gas exploration companies (587 points), commercial banks (392 points), fertiliser (315 points), cement (185 points), and power generation and distribution (166 points). Sectors that contributed negatively were miscellaneous (13 points), glass & ceramics (3.2 points), investment banks (1.3 points), modarbas (one point) and leasing companies (0.1 points).\n\nScrip-wise positive contributors were Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (268 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (258 points), Fauji Fertiliser Company (151 points), Hub Power Company Ltd (120 points), and United Bank Ltd (102 points). Meanwhile, scrip-wise negative contributions came from Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans Ltd (12 points), Askari Bank Ltd (6 points), Ghani Glass Ltd (4.8 points), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (4.5 points), and BankIslami Pakistan Ltd (3.6 points).\n\nForeign selling clocked in at $3.1m compared to $1.9m in the preceding week. Major selling was witnessed in exploration and production ($1.95m) and banks ($1m).\n\nOn the local front, buying was reported by other organisations ($5.5m) and banks ($5.4m). Average daily volume arrived at 687m shares, up by 5.4pc week-on-week. The average daily value settled at $69.6m, up by 11.6pc from the preceding week.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd observed that the surge in the benchmark KSE 100-share can largely be attributed to aggressive institutional buying after the IMF announced its executive board is meeting on Jan 11 to approve $700m tranche for Pakistan.\n\nGoing forward, AKD Securities Ltd said the market is anticipated to maintain its bullish momentum, fuelled by the disbursement of the IMF second tranche. The forthcoming elections will be closely watched, and uncertainty surrounding their outcome could potentially hinder the market\u2019s bullish trend.\n\nHowever, a peaceful resolution could provide a significant boost to investor confidence. Our recommendation to investors is to maintain long-term positions in companies with strong fundamentals while tactfully managing any fundamentally weak entities through a timely profit-taking strategy.\n\nAdditionally, companies offering robust dividend yields, especially in the banking, energy, and fertiliser sectors, present opportunities for accumulation, noted AKD Securities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2024",

The PSX issued notices to these companies on December 20, 2023, seeking clarification on this unexpected fluctuation.\n\nAccording to the PSX data, the share prices and volumes of these companies showed significant variations between November 16, 2023 and December 15, 2023.\n\nAmong the companies that have received notices from the PSX are two banks, namely The Bank of Punjab and Samba Bank Limited.\n\nOther firms that are also under scrutiny include First Punjab Modaraba, Unicap Modaraba, Sapphire Fibres Limited, Reliance Insurance Company Limited, Pakistan National Shipping Corporation Limited, Pak-Gulf Leasing Company Limited, Pak Elektron Limited, Otsuka Pakistan Limited, The National Silk & Rayon Mills Limited, K-Electric Limited, Universal Network Systems Limited, First Treet Manufacturing Modaraba, First Habib Modaraba, Fauji Fertilizer Bin Qasim Limited, First Elite Capital Modaraba, Chakwal Spinning Mills Limited, and Agritech Limited.\n\nThe PSX has requested these companies to provide any material or price-sensitive information that is likely to affect the price of their shares if it is not already available to the public as stipulated under the PSX Regulation.\n\nThe stock exchange stated that this development underscores the vigilance and regulatory oversight exercised by the PSX aimed at ensuring that all market participants operate within a framework defined by transparency and integrity.\n\nThe market analysts are speculating that the unusual movement in the share prices and volumes of these companies could be due to the rumors of possible mergers, acquisitions, expansions, or other strategic decisions by these companies or their competitors.\n\nThe PSX has warned that if any of the companies fail to comply with the PSX Regulation, they may face disciplinary action as per the PSX Rules.\n\nFollowing the PSX letter, Sapphire Fibres Limited, Samba Bank, Pakistan National Shipping Corporation, GEMUNSL, First Punjab Modaraba and Agritech Limited said on December 21 that they did not know of any cause/ significant information that could have led to the abnormal change in market price or volume during the specified time period.",

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "The government raised Rs479 billion through the sale of one-year Ijarah Sukuk at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), attracting 16 times more than the target amount of Rs30 billion.\n\nThe event was attended by caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar, and PSX MD and CEO Farrukh H Khan, among others.\n\nThe PM said the auction was a remarkable achievement for the entire market ecosystem and reflected the confidence of investors in the economy. He said the government had addressed the structural and macroeconomic issues and improved the fiscal and external accounts.\n\nThe auction marked the first time that the Ministry of Finance conducted a primary market auction of government debt securities at the PSX, in addition to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).\n\nThe cut-off yield for the Sukuk was below 20%, which was significantly lower than the average 22% return on one-year T-bills. The auction was aimed at simplifying the participation in government securities, diversifying the investor base, and enhancing transparency.\n\nThe finance minister said the auction was a momentous occasion for the financial markets and the economy of Pakistan. She said the amendment to existing rules had enabled the raising of government debt in capital markets.\n\nThe PSX chief said the auction would augment efficiency, flexibility, registration, trading and transfer of the government debt securities.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the PSX announced it would hold the first-ever auction of listed government Ijara Sukuk bonds in a bid to raise Rs90 billion from the sale of one-year Islamic bonds between December 2023 and February 2024. The bonds are based on the Shariah-compliant principle of Ijarah, which involves the leasing of assets.\n\nThe auction was said to be held through the Capital Market Infrastructure Institutions (CMIIs), which include the PSX, the National Clearing and Settlement Company of Pakistan (NCCPL), and the Central Depository Company of Pakistan (CDC).\n\nThe Ministry of Finance had recently approved some amendments to the rules governing the issuance, registration, trading, and transfer of government debt securities through the CMIIs, allowing the PSX to conduct the primary market issuance.\n\nNow, the second auction will be held on January 23, with the same target of Rs30 billion, and settlement on January 24, 2023. The third and final auction will be held in February 2024, with a target of Rs30 billion and settlement on the same day as the auction date.",

            "text": "KARACHI: In a move to attract small investors who shy away from stock investing partly because of excessive documentation, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has \u201cfurther simplified\u201d the brokerage account-opening procedure.\n\nIn a brief note on Thursday, the national bourse said it has made a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in the number of data fields required for customer on-boarding.\n\nAs a result, the updated Sahulat KYC (know-your-client) and account-opening forms now require only identity details, address, income level, profession, source of income and bank account information.\n\nLaunched in April 2022, the Sahulat Account lets small retail investors buy and sell shares on the PSX by opening a basic account with a brokerage house after submitting their computerised/smart national identity cards.\n\nAll licensed securities brokers are now offering Sahulat Accounts, which can be opened online as well.\n\nUnlike traditional brokerage accounts, investors don\u2019t have to submit any specific evidence for their source of income for opening Sahulat Acco\u00adunts. In other words, brokers won\u2019t require salary slips or bank statements from potential stock market investors if they choose to open this kind of brokerage accounts.\n\nAny individual identified as \u201clow risk\u201d through risk assessment can open a Sahulat Account. The securities broker may apply simplified due-diligence measures, which include the verification of the identity of customers.\n\nDespite being as old as the country itself, the stock exchange has an extremely low investor base. The number of individual accounts was only 290,316 at the end of July 2023. The number of accounts held by institutional investors and \u201cfunds/others\u201d totalled 1,803 and 1,285, respectively.\n\nFor context, the number of crypto wallets \u2014 which hold the keys to investors\u2019 digital coins stored on public blockchain networks \u2014 in Pakistan hovers around 10 million despite a big question mark on their legal status.\n\nThe low number of retail investors means companies as well as the government face difficulty in mobilising public funds in a cost-efficient manner.\n\nThe general public tends to park their money with banks, which lend mainly to the government that, in turn, uses those funds to finance its budget deficit at a high interest rate.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 3rd, 2023",

            "text": "Faysal Bank Limited (PSX: FABL) announced on Thursday to set up a fully-owned exchange company with an initial capital injection of Rs 1 billion.\n\nThis move aligns with the provisions outlined in Sections 96 and 131 of the Securities Act, 2015, and Regulation 5.6.1 of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) Rule Book.\n\nDuring a board meeting held on September 27, 2023, Faysal Bank Limited\u2019s board of directors approved the establishment of an exchange company, starting with an initial paid-up capital of Rs 1 billion, pending clearance and approval from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), bank\u2019s filing in the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) said.\n\nThis development follows recent efforts to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP has pledged to institute structural reforms in the exchange company sector, emphasizing the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe primary aim of this crackdown is to enhance oversight of the open market and strengthen governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures within the sector. The minimum capital requirement for exchange companies has been raised from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional requirement that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that Faysal Bank Limited joins the ranks of major banks keen on participating in this transformative shift. United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), and Allied Bank Limited (ABL) have all recently indicated their intentions to establish their own forex companies.\n\nHabib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had already ventured into exchange companies before the introduction of these new regulatory measures by the SBP.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Stock investors opted to book profits in the outgoing week, which resulted in the benchmark index closing in the red.\n\nArif Habib Ltd said market-driving news included the Asian Development Bank announcing a $1.2 billion loan agreement with Pakistan. In addition, the World Bank approved $350 million for economic reforms.\n\nAfter June 2023, Pakistan recorded for the first time a monthly current account surplus of $9m. Additionally, the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) approved a proposal from the Power Division to settle the dues of government-owned power plants using a supplementary grant of Rs262bn. The ECC also approved the release of an advance subsidy of Rs57bn concerning K-Electric Ltd arrears.\n\nIn November, Pakistan witnessed a notable year-on-year rise of nearly 20pc in the average power generation cost, which is largely attributed to an increase in generation from expensive fuels. Additionally, foreign exchange reserves of the State Bank of Pakistan declined by $138m to reach $6.9bn.\n\nDuring the week, the rupee closed at 282.53 against the greenback after appreciating by 0.26pc week-on-week.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 61,705 points following a decline of 4,425 points or 6.7pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise, negative contributions came from commercial banking (1,029 points), fertiliser (785 points), oil and gas exploration (576 points), cement (388 points) and technology and communication (294 points). Meanwhile, the only sector that contributed positively was miscellaneous (16 points).\n\nScrip-wise, negative contributors were MCB Bank Ltd (265 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (257 points), Engro Corporation Ltd (251 points), Dawood Hercules Corporation Ltd (240 points) and Fauji Fertiliser Company Ltd (174 points).\n\nPositive contributions came from Pakistan Services Ltd (17 points), Interloop Ltd (five points), Pakgen Power Ltd (two points) and Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans Ltd (one point).\n\nForeign buying clocked in at $2.4m versus a net purchase of $6.3m a week ago. Major buying was witnessed in power generation and distribution ($3.5m) and cement ($1.1m). On the local front, selling was reported by mutual funds ($14.3m) and individuals ($2.6m). The average daily traded volume arrived at 1.2bn shares, down 3pc week-on-week. The average daily value traded settled at $78m, down 27pc week-on-week.\n\nAccording to AKD Securities Ltd, the stock market may see a correction going forward. \u201cOur advice to investors is to retain long-term positions in companies with solid fundamentals,\u201d it said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, December 24th, 2023",

            "text": "Bears continued to dominate the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday and dragged its benchmark index down by over 900 points.\n\nAccording to the PSX website, the KSE-100 index lost 931.98 points to stand at 61,841.74, down 1.48 per cent, from the previous close of 62,773.72 points.\n\nThe benchmark of representative shares opened the week a day earlier with a decline of more than 1,000 points, the biggest single-day fall in over a month. The losses were attributed to profit-taking ahead of the announcement of the monetary policy.\n\nToday, energy stocks such as K-Electric Limited, World Telecom Limited, Hascol Petroleum Limited, Pakistan Telecommunication Company Limited and Pakistan Refinery Limited witnessed major activity.\n\nShahab Farooq, director of research at Next Capital Limited, attributed the bearish momentum to political uncertainty ahead of the February 8 general elections.\n\n\u201cGeopolitical concerns, along with foreign selling, restricted market performance,\u201d he told Dawn.com, adding that the market was expected to remain volatile in the near term.\n\nYousuf M. Farooq, director of research at Chase Securities, echoed similar sentiments. He noted that the PSX remained under pressure due to foreign selling and election uncertainty.\n\nHe said that there was \u201csome disappointment\u201d due to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP)\u2019s outlook regarding inflationary pressure in the monetary policy statement yesterday. However, Farooq highlighted that inflation was expected to gradually decline over the coming months.\n\nA day earlier, the central bank kept the interest rate unchanged at 22pc and increased the inflation target in the range of 23 to 25pc for the current fiscal year.\n\n\u201cParticipants expect the SBP to reduce the policy rate in its next meeting in March. Political uncertainty will likely keep investors jittery in the stock market, and volatility could persist until there is clarity on the political front,\u201d Farooq added.\n\nAbdul Azeem, head of research at Spectrum Securities Limited, observed that the index \u201cwitnessed a significant contraction\u201d and attributed the decline to political uncertainty and sustained foreign selling.\n\n\u201cThe special court\u2019s decision to impose a 10-year sentence on Imran Khan and Shah Mahmood Qureshi, coupled with foreigners selling $17.7 million worth of shares during the last two sessions, eroded investor confidence and led to heightened selling pressure in the market,\u201d he said.\n\nAzeem further noted that international oil prices had increased by $0.23 per barrel, reaching $77.02 \u201camid concerns over falling demand also had a negative impact on the market\u201d.\n\nAwais Ashraf, director of research at Akseer Research, also said that political uncertainty ahead of polls, MPC\u2019s decision to maintain the status quo and foreign selling amid a \u201cdeteriorating law and order situation\u201d caused the index to nosedive today.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Growing doubts about the formation of a new coalition government amid raging protests against alleged manipulation of election results across the country kept the market sentiment depressed in the outgoing week.\n\nThe equities received a massive battering on the first day of the trading week as nervous investors resorted to panic-selling amid an inordinate delay in announcing a clear-cut power-sharing formula by the PML-N and the PPP wiping out 1, 878 points in a single session.\n\nIn the subsequent two sessions, the market showed a mild recovery after some progress had been reported on the PML-N-PPP coalition setup. However, the announcement by the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf that it would form governments in the Centre, Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa with nominations for prime minister and chief ministers jolted the market sentiments and as a result the index lost over 2,280 points in the last two sessions taking the index below the 60,000 level.\n\nHence, the KSE 100-share index closed at 59,872.96 points plunging by a staggering 3,071.04 points or 4.9pc week-on-week.\n\nArif Habib Ltd said besides political uncertainty, the rejection of the proposed plans related to curtailment of the energy circular debt and industrial power tariff by the International Monetary Fund also dented investor confidence.\n\nFurthermore, the caretaker federal cabinet\u2019s approval of a massive hike in gas prices drew strong reactions from across all segments, particularly industrialists. Also, there was a rise in the prices of petrol and diesel.\n\nHowever, the large-scale manufacturing output rose by 3.4pc year-on-year in December. Remittances jumped 26pc to $2.4 billion in January.\n\nMoreover, the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s reserves inched up by $12 million, reaching $8.1 billion.

            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) remained bullish in the outgoing week, thanks to a range of positive developments such as the rupee\u2019s comprehensive strengthening and the potential easing of inflation.\n\nDeliberations among government circles for the privatisation of loss-making state-owned enterprises (SOEs) also lifted the market\u2019s sentiment.\n\nIn addition, news reports stating that the European Parliament had extended Pakistan\u2019s GSP Plus status for four years and the decline in government\u2019s bond yields also aided the KSE-100 index\u2019s advance.\n\nInvestors also weighed the next State Bank\u2019s monetary policy, with the rupee standing at 282.69/$ at the end of the eventful week on Friday, and falling government bond yields also vitalised investors\u2019 enthusiasm, leading to bullish activity in the market.\n\nAs a result, the benchmark KSE-100 index closed at 47,493.57, with an increase of 41.19 points, or 2.7% week-on-week (WoW).\n\nThe bourse started the week on Monday with an impressive bullish rally, driven mainly by a positive economic outlook ahead of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) review meetings before the release of the next loan tranche. The next day, the index maintained its upward march and advanced gradually towards the 47,000 mark, following upbeat data that showed a 48% fall in the trade deficit for September.\n\nOn Wednesday, the benchmark KSE-100 index continued its upward trajectory as it breached the crucial 47,000 barrier on a number of positive triggers, which helped maintain the positive momentum.\n\nOn the following day, stocks maintained their bullish trend and surged by 0.09% as investors were optimistic ahead of major corporate earnings announcements due next week.\n\nOn the last day of the trading week, the PSX rose by around 41.19 points, closing the week with a spectacular performance through five consecutive days.\n\nJS Global analyst Muhammad Waqas Ghani, in his market review, wrote that the KSE-100 index was up by 2.7% WoW this week, closing at 47,493, reporting a positive closing for five consecutive days. Volumes picked up by 44% WoW to 291 million shares.\n\nForeign investors remained net sellers throughout the week, offloading $12 million worth of equities. Investor sentiment remained positive over declining international oil prices and appreciating PKR against the US dollar, he added.\n\nHe highlighted that the government reduced domestic petrol prices by Rs8/litre and Rs11/litre for diesel for the current fortnight in the wake of a drop in international prices, which also added to the stock\u2019s momentum.\n\nTopline Securities, in its weekly commentary, wrote that the KSE 100 Index gained 2.73% on a WoW basis. It attributed the positivity of the market to the decline in international crude oil prices, appreciation of PKR against the US dollar on the back of ongoing action against speculation/hoarding, and Ministry of Finance instruction to ministries to implement all the commitments made with the IMF as the first review under the SBA becomes due.\n\nTopline cited that major developments during the week were September CPI Inflation clocking in at 31.4% YoY, compared to 27.4% in August 2023.

Moreover, the expectation of robust results for 1QFY24 kept the market participants vested.\n\nThe urea and DAP sales witnessed a jump of 11% and 68% YoY, respectively in Sep\u201923.

Bills and 3-Y PIB witnessed a decline of 29 bps and 15 bps, respectively, in the auction held this week. Though inflation climbed up to 31.4% in September 2023, the ongoing decline in international oil prices and consistent appreciation of PKR against the US dollar has eased some investor concerns regarding inflation, as both will provide a much-needed cushion, it added.\n\nThe market closed at 47,494 points, gaining 1,261 points, or 2.7% WoW. Sector-wise positive contributions came from Commercial Banks (413 points), Fertiliser (281 points), Cement (176 points), Power (81 points), and Technology (77 points).\n\nOn the flip side, sectors that recorded losses include Exploration and Production (48 points), and Miscellaneous (14 points).
