            "text": "KARACHI: Conditionalities before the start of the final review with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and uncertainty about the possibility of a rate cut given the Ramazan-driven spike in inflation\n\nkept investors in a jittery mood as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed the outgoing week in the red.\n\nArif Habib Ltd (AHL) said the stock market remained under pressure throughout the outgoing week, primarily due to divided opinions about the upcoming monetary policy decision, alongside the government\u2019s negotiations with the IMF for final review.\n\nConcurrently, the formation of the cabinet and the appointment of Muhammad Aurangzeb as finance minister brought resolution to lingering uncertainties.\n\nAKD Securities Ltd said the additional conditionalities including expanding the tax net, removing specialised tax regimes, reviewing the NFC award, halting gas supply to power producers, and terminating gas subsidies for fertiliser plants all seem to be long-term goals that are put forward by the lender to possibly include in the budget 2024-25 budget.\n\nOn the economic front, according to AHL, the government raised Rs93bn against a target of Rs50bn through Ijarah sukuk, while broad money (M2) increased by Rs496bn to Rs32.7 trillion as of March 1. Additionally, the SBP reserves increased by $17 million to $7.9bn in the week ending on March 8. The rupee appreciated slightly against the US dollar at Rs278.74 gaining 29 paise or 0.11pc week-on-week.\n\nHence, the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed at 64,816 points, down by 977 points or 1.5pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise negative contributions came from fertiliser (215 points), oil & gas exploration (190 points), commercial banks (174 points), oil & gas marketing companies (103 points) and power (55 points). Meanwhile, the sectors which mainly contributed positively were automobile parts (20 points), paper & board (6 points) and chemicals (4 points).\n\nScrip-wise negative contributors were Dawood Hercules (203 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (108 points), Engro Corporation (78 points), Bank Al-Habib Ltd (68 points) and United Bank Ltd (68 points). On the flip side, scrip-wise positive contributions came from Meezan Bank Ltd (62 points), Engro Fertiliser (52 points), Lucky Cement (47 points), Thal Ltd (20 points), and Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (18 points).\n\nForeign buying continued during the outgoing week, clocking in at $2.7m compared to a net buy of $6.3m last week. Major buying was witnessed in commercial banks ($1.9m) and cement ($1.83m). On the local front, selling was reported by companies ($2.5m) followed by broker proprietary ($1.7m). Average volume dipped 20.1pc to 340m shares while the average value traded witnessed a steep fall of 30.5pc to $41m week-on-week.\n\nAHL said on the successful conclusion of the IMF review, Pakistan would receive the final tranche\n\nof $1.1bn under the current $3bn Stand-By Arrangement. Additionally, the energy minister has emphasised the importance of addressing the energy circular debt, with efforts to expedite its resolution underway any favourable progress in this regard would uplift market sentiment.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 17th, 2024",

            "text": "In 2023, the banking industry performed exceptionally well. It set new benchmarks and exceeded historical highs. One of the key highlights was the significant increase in dividends, rising by an amazing 84% compared to the previous year.\n\nWith outstanding price performance, the banking sector outperformed the PSX in 2023, achieving an amazing 85 percent return as opposed to the index\u2019s 55 percent. The industry\u2019s profitability enjoyed record-breaking growth.\n\nArif Habib Limited reports that a notable 85 percent YoY growth in interest income was the primary driver of the notable jump in profitability. The policy rate rising by 600 basis points and the year-over-year growth in deposits are two of the reasons for this increase.\n\nRegretfully, banks\u2019 involvement in funding the private sector is still restricted to boosting the real sector\u2019s GDP. Because of this, most banks had record-breaking profits in the previous year and made significant contributions to the national coffers due to their many tax payments, which also resulted in historically high values.\n\nRead More: CDA Mandates Capital\u2019s Hotels to Install Eco-friendly Waste Disposal Plants\n\nIn order to increase their bottom-line revenue, banks intend to create distinct subsidiaries to boost their foreign exchange operations.\n\nThe top ten profitable banks in Pakistan are as follows:\n\n1. Meezan Bank\n\nMeezan continued to be Pakistan\u2019s most profitable bank. Being the premier Islamic bank, it posted an astonishing profit of Rs. 84.5 billion in 2023 compared to Rs. 45 billion in 2022, indicating an 87 percent year-over-year increase.\n\nAt the end of the year, the bank had reached a number of significant milestones, with deposits and assets totaling Rs. 2 trillion and Rs. 3 trillion, respectively. The bank expanded its nationwide network as well, adding more than 1,000 locations and ATMs. A total dividend of Rs. 28 per share was also paid to the bank\u2019s stockholders. Additionally, the value of the shares rose from 25.1 to 47.1 during the reviewed year.\n\nUnfortunately, Sukuk\u2019s extremely limited function in providing funding to support enterprises and entrepreneurs continues to be the bank\u2019s primary priority.\n\n2. MCB Bank\n\nMCB Bank continued to hold the second spot. Its profitability increased tremendously by 89 percent to Rs. 65.3 billion in 2022 from Rs. 34.45 billion in 2022. Additionally, the bank raised its ownership of 81 percent in the asset management company, which made a substantial profit contribution. In contrast to the previous year\u2019s reported EPS of Rs. 27.6, the earnings per share climbed to Rs. 50.1. The bank gave stockholders dividends of Rs. 21 per share.\n\n3. Habib Bank Limited\n\nIn 2023, Habib Bank Limited recorded its greatest profit of Rs. 57.8 billion, a 68 percent increase over the previous year. The bank\u2019s assets and deposits reached above Rs. 5 trillion and Rs. 4.1 trillion, respectively, its highest-ever levels. In 2023, earnings per share was Rs. 39.32, up from Rs. 23.23 in 2022. The bank gave its stockholder\u2019s dividend payments of Rs. 9.25 per share.\n\nIn order to take advantage of new business prospects in the agri-economy, the bank expanded its operations in the agriculture sector by establishing a new specialized subsidiary. Other banks are expected to follow suit. By turning the Pakistan Super League into a national brand, the bank\u2019s leadership upheld its heritage of aiding the country\u2019s interests. Additionally, by giving the IT sector more influence, it advanced the development of Tech Destination Pakistan.\n\nRead More: SBP Reserves up Marginally to $8.05 Billion\n\n4. United Bank Limited\n\nWith a 74 percent increase over the same period last year, United Bank Limited announced its highest-ever year profit after tax of Rs. 56.47 billion in 2023. The bank continued to be generous in its dividend payments to stockholders; in one calendar year, the highest payout amount was Rs. 44 per share. In a year, the bank\u2019s share value rose from 25.4 to 47. By the end of 2023, the bank\u2019s deposits had nearly reached Rs. 2.2 trillion, and its assets had increased to over Rs. 5 trillion. The bank\u2019s management began working hard that same year to establish its currency exchange operation. Like in 2022, the bank remained in fourth place in 2023.\n\n5. National Bank of Pakistan\n\nThe National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) experienced a significant increase in profitability as well, with its bottom line reaching a record-breaking Rs. 53.3 billion. When compared to the previous year\u2019s earnings of Rs. 30.9 billion, the bank\u2019s profit increased by 72%.\n\nThe bank\u2019s assets increased to more than Rs 6.5 trillion, the biggest amount ever seen in the nation\u2019s banking sector. It now has about Rs. 3.6 trillion in deposits. By the end of 2023, the bank\u2019s earnings per share had likewise increased to 24.96. Regretfully, no dividend announcement was made to shareholders by the bank. Regarding the most profitable banks in Pakistan, the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) remained ranked fifth.\n\n6. Standard Chartered Bank\n\nOut of all the major banks, Standard Chartered Bank had the highest profit growth, rising by 115% year over year. From an all-time high profit of Rs. 19.8 billion in 2022 to Rs. 45.6 billion in 2023, the bank\u2019s profitability increased.\n\nThe bank\u2019s assets now total over Rs. 1 trillion, marking a significant accomplishment. Additionally, deposits increased to Rs. 720 billion. Additionally, the bank\u2019s earnings per share increased by over 100%, from 5.1 to 11. The bank moved up one spot to become Pakistan\u2019s sixth most profitable bank.\n\n7. Allied Bank of Pakistan\n\nOne of Pakistan\u2019s oldest banks, Allied Bank of Pakistan (ABL), also experienced a respectable 91 percent increase in profits in 2023 over the previous year. From Rs. 21.9 billion in 2022 to Rs. 40.6 billion in 2023, the bank\u2019s profitability grew. The bank declared 35.53 earnings per share. After the quarterly results were disclosed, it declared a dividend income of Rs. 12 per share for the entire year. The bank saw a historically strong gain in profits, but its ranking fell from fifth to sixth.\n\nRead More: Railways Accelerate Efforts to Retrieve 13,927 Acres of Land Across Pak\n\n8. Bank Alfalah\n\nThe bank reported a profit after tax of Rs. 36.456 billion, up almost 100% from Rs. 18.206 billion in the previous year. The earnings per share (EPS) has increased from Rs. 10.27 to Rs. 23.12. In 2023, it distributed a total dividend of Rs. 8 per share.\n\nThe bank has established a digitally-enabled lifestyle banking branch. Additionally, it bought more than 7% of the shares in a BNPL company. The bank has achieved two noteworthy benchmarks: one trillion rupees in deposits and one thousand branches.\n\n9. Bank Al Habib\n\nIn 2023, Bank Al Habib recorded a respectable 113% increase in profits. The bank\u2019s profit in 2023 was Rs. 35.3 billion, up from the biggest profit the firm had ever declared in 2022 of Rs. 16.5 billion. The bank\u2019s earnings per share increased as well, reaching 31.7. Throughout the year, the bank gave its stockholders dividends of Rs. 14 per share. In 2023, the bank remained ranked in relation to the previous year.\n\n10. Habib Metro Bank\n\nComparing the Rs. 14.92 billion reported in 2022 to the Rs. 25.2 billion recorded in 2023, Habib Metro Bank also declared its highest-ever profit. The bank\u2019s earnings per share increased to Rs. 23.4 as well. Additionally, stockholders received a notable increase in dividends of Rs. 10.50 per share. The bank was given permission to establish an exchange company as a subsidiary, just like its rival banks.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn 2023, the top 10 banks on the list from the previous year did not change. Surprisingly, the majority of banks held onto their profits positions, with the exception of Standard Chartered Bank and Allied Bank, which moved up from sixth to seventh place, respectively.\n\nThe profit differential between the most profitable bank and the second-most profitable bank is substantial. Several rival banks, including Bank of Punjab, Habib Metro Bank, and Faysal Bank, lost their rankings on this list.\n\nUnusually, in 2024, the profits of two banks\u2014HBL and UBL\u2014showed growth in the face of increased competition. Banks are expected to continue growing their profits in 2024, even with a high policy rate regime. Banks that prioritize diversifying their sources of income and utilizing technology will have an advantage over their competitors in terms of profitability.\n\nFor more news, visit the Al Sadat Marketing Website.",
