            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

On the flip side, Mari Petroleum, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank, Habib Bank and Bank Alhabib Ltd lost value to weigh down on the index by 226 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 63,813.06 points after shedding 484.94 points or 0.75 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume further dipped by 10.39pc to 412.82 million shares. The traded value also plunged by 35.89pc to Rs16.18bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan International Airline Corporation Ltd (66.17m shares), K-Electric (47.10m shares), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (31.07m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (20.13m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (18.82m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Atlas Honda Ltd (Rs28.52), Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs25.42), JS Global Capital Ltd (Rs11.64), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs11.45) and JDW Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs10.00).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs400.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs82.29), Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs44.89), Siemens Pakistan Ltd (Rs32.01) and Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs25.00).\n\nForeign investors indulged in aggressive selling as they disposed of shares worth $10.05m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 27th, 2024",

However, Bank AlHabib, MCB Bank, Engro Corporation and Meezan Bank Ltd came under selling pressure cumulatively wiping out 121 points from the index.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 65,603.09 points after shedding 53.53 points or 0.08 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume fell 15.62pc to 354.15 million shares. The traded value also dipped 21.27pc to Rs14.43bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pak Elek\u00adtron (31.07m shares), Tele\u00adcard Ltd (22.63m shares), P.I.A.C.(A) (21.56m shares), WorldCall Tele\u00adcom Ltd (20.84m shares), and Cnergyico PK Ltd (19.36 million shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods (Rs400), Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs111.12), Sazgar Engineering (Rs28.72) Al-Abbas Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs16.60) and Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs7.54).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan (Rs310.00), Meh\u00admood Textile (Rs22.50), Dawood Lawrencepur (Rs11.75), Pakistan Hotels Developers Ltd (Rs11.27) and Service Industries Ltd (Rs6.44).\n\nForeign investors remai\u00adned net buyers as they pic\u00adked shares worth $3.49m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 8th, 2024",

            "text": "KARACHI: After rallying for three consecutive sessions, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Thursday faltered amid uncertainty about whether the International Monetary Fund would give its go-ahead to the government\u2019s plans for reducing industrial power tariff and energy sector circular debt.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said unconfirmed reports of a row over the proposed circular debt management plan dampened investor sentiments.\n\nHowever, the caretaker prime minister on Wednesday directed the energy ministry to formulate an effective and durable strategy to do away with the circular debt.\n\nThe slashing of cut-off yields by up to 62 basis points for different T-bill tenors kept the banking sector under pressure.\n\nFurthermore, weak auto sector earnings and uncertainty about SBP\u2019s monetary policy direction amid high inflation also played a role in the bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said a selling spree was witnessed in energy stocks, especially in Oil and Gas Development Com\u00adpany (OGDCL) and Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (PPL).\n\nCollectively OGDCL, PPL, Bank Alhabib, Hub Power and PSO negatively contributed 510 points to the index. On the flip side, Engro Corporation, Mee\u00adzan Bank and Engro Ferti\u00adlisers added 137 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,298.01 points after losing 524.43 points or 0.81 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume dipped 4.01pc to 460.69 million shares. The traded value, however, rose 12.20pc to Rs25.24bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (49.67m shares), K-Electric (48.97m shares), Hascol Petroleum Ltd (38.80m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (27.37m shares) and Fauji Fertiliser Bin Qasim Ltd (24.11m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs57.00), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs55.43), Al-Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs37.45), Faisal Spinning Mills Ltd (Rs17.17) and Bata Pakistan Ltd (Rs15.24).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd(Rs199.98), Philip Morris (Pakistan) Ltd (Rs53.88), Archroma Pakistan Ltd (Rs22.98), Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs16.76) and Oil and Gas Development Company (Rs9.42).\n\nForeign investors continued offloading their positions as they disposed of shares worth $6.06m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 26th, 2024",

            "text": "KARACHI: Despite persistent political volatility, the stock market on Monday reversed the gloomy trend on renewed buying interest in selective sectors as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index partially recovered overnight losses to settle above the 60,000 level.\n\nHowever, global credit agency Fitch Ratings in its latest report has warned that the closely contested election outcome has raised serious concerns about Pakistan\u2019s pursuit to reach a crucial financing agreement with the International Monetary Fund after the expiration of the current $3bn Stand-By Arrangement next month.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the market opened on a negative note as the index declined to make an intraday low of 681 points to 59,191.86 amid a lack of clarity on the formation of a new government.\n\nHowever, investors went for cherry-picking after the Supreme Court postponed the hearing of the petition that sought to declare the Feb 8 general elections as \u2018null and void\u2019 due to the petitioner\u2019s non-appearance.\n\nOil and Gas Development Company Ltd, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, Hub Power Company Ltd, Engro Corporation and Bank Al-Habib cumulatively contributed 419 points to the index\u2019s positive performance. On the flip side, United Bank Ltd, Nestle Pakistan, Colgate-Palmolive, Dawood Hercules and Pakistan Oilfield Ltd took away 88 points.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said speculations about a breakthrough in negotiations between PML-N and Pakistan Peoples Party over a coalition government power-sharing formula later in the day eased political instability fuelling a sharp recovery at the PSX.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 60,459.75 points after adding 586.79 points or 0.98 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume dipped 16.68pc to 261.79 million shares. The traded value also fell 19.07pc to Rs9.90bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (21.40m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (20.03m shares), Pakistan Refinery Ltd (15.16m shares), Cnergyico PK Ltd (14.12m shares) and K-Electric (13.20m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Rafhan Maize Ltd (Rs373.75), Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs51.28), Pakistan Tob\u00adacco Company Ltd (Rs48.66), Shield Corp\u00adoration Ltd (Rs18.04) and Sazgar Engineering Ltd (Rs16.57).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan (Rs289.89), Pakistan Engineering Com\u00adpany Ltd (Rs38.25), Meh\u00admood Textile (Rs35.87), Colgate-Palm\u00adolive (Rs19.46) and Siemens Pakistan Ltd (Rs19.04).\n\nForeign investors turned net sellers as they offloaded shares worth $1.05m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 20th, 2024",
