            "text": "Allied Bank Limited (ABL) unveiled its plans on Wednesday to establish a wholly-owned exchange company, with an initial capital of Rs 1 billion.\n\nThis significant decision aligns with the provisions outlined in Sections 96 and 131 of the Securities Act, 2015, and Regulation 5.6.1 of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) Rule Book.\n\nThe announcement was made following a board of directors\u2019 circular resolution dated September 27, 2023. According to ABL\u2019s official stock filing, the establishment of this exchange company, with an initial paid-up capital of Rs 1,000 million (Rs 1 billion), remains subject to approval and clearance by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).\n\nThis development comes in the wake of recent measures aimed at curbing illicit activities within the black market. The SBP\u2019s subsequent pledge to usher in structural reforms in the exchange companies\u2019 sector underscores the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe core objective of this crackdown was to tighten oversight of the open market while fortifying governance structures, internal controls, and compliance protocols within the sector. The minimum capital requirement for exchange companies has been raised from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional requirement that the capital be free of losses.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that ABL now joins the ranks of major banks eager to participate in this transformative shift. United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), and Bank AL Habib (BAHL) have all recently signaled their intentions to establish their own forex companies. Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had already ventured into exchange companies before the introduction of these new regulatory measures by the SBP.",

            "text": "Faysal Bank Limited (PSX: FABL) announced on Thursday to set up a fully-owned exchange company with an initial capital injection of Rs 1 billion.\n\nThis move aligns with the provisions outlined in Sections 96 and 131 of the Securities Act, 2015, and Regulation 5.6.1 of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) Rule Book.\n\nDuring a board meeting held on September 27, 2023, Faysal Bank Limited\u2019s board of directors approved the establishment of an exchange company, starting with an initial paid-up capital of Rs 1 billion, pending clearance and approval from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), bank\u2019s filing in the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) said.\n\nThis development follows recent efforts to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP has pledged to institute structural reforms in the exchange company sector, emphasizing the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe primary aim of this crackdown is to enhance oversight of the open market and strengthen governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures within the sector. The minimum capital requirement for exchange companies has been raised from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional requirement that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that Faysal Bank Limited joins the ranks of major banks keen on participating in this transformative shift. United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), and Allied Bank Limited (ABL) have all recently indicated their intentions to establish their own forex companies.\n\nHabib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had already ventured into exchange companies before the introduction of these new regulatory measures by the SBP.",

            "text": "More than 1/4th of the total market capitalisation of companies listed at the Pakistan Stock Exchange was added in three months \u2014 September, October, and November 2023.\n\nSince then, for the last two months, the KSE-100 index has been within range, with the lowest at 59,170 and the highest at 66,426, as the market awaited clarity expected after the elections.\n\nBut the election results have only increased the uncertainty, as no single party won a majority, reflected in a deep negative opening on the first few days after the market opened on February 9.\n\nThis leads to the question as to what the future trend in the market could be. For this we need to evaluate what has led to gains in the past few months and the trend in the stocks\u2019 performance.\n\nNew govt will have to introduce long-term financing plan: Moody\u2019s\n\nMost of the high gaining stocks (excluding dividends) since September 1, 2023, when the market started rising, are from the following sectors: (prices of February 7, 2024 / August 31, 2023)\n\nAutomobile assembler (PSMC up:494%, SAZEW up:224%)\n\nTransport (PIAA up:195%, PNSC up:136%)\n\nTechnology and communication (Airlink up:176%, PTC up:94%)\n\nPower generation and distribution (KEL up:147%, LPL up:61%)\n\nSugar and allied industries (SHSML up:140%, HABSM up:92%)\n\nRefinery (PRL up:107%)\n\nFertilizer (FFBL up:100%, EFERT up:62%)\n\nOil and gas exploration companies (PPL up:77%, OGDC up:56%)\n\nCommercial banking (BOP up:77%, JSBL up:74%)\n\nSome of these stocks, which are also constituents of the KSE-100, had major contributions in the 19,000-point increase in the index from September 1, 2023 to February 7, 2024. Only the top 5 stocks added 5,700 points to the index during this period; OGDC: 1,300 points, PPL: 1,200 points, HUBC: 1,200 points, EFERT:1,100 points, UBL: 900 points (approx.)\n\nThroughout CY23, companies and foreign corporates were the major buyers and they continued to remain so during the last few months, however, major shift in the sentiment of insurance companies in the first half of August 2023, becoming net buyers from net sellers, fueled the upside movement in the market.\n\nMoody\u2019s says timely election result to reduce uncertainty in Pakistan: report\n\nBesides macro-economic factors, the positive sentiment in the market was built by multiple company specific factors, including significant dividend payouts and major buy-back announcements by large size companies, delisting of an automobile company, improved pricing of gas for its impact on circular debt, approval of refinery policy, progress on privatisation and expectation of resolution of circular debt through dividends.\n\nSome of these factors influencing market sentiment will depend on the policy of the new government coming into power, while others are not directly related, which would keep those gains sticky.\n\nThe economic challenges ahead require a government that can continue reforms, including the completion of the second review under the stand-by arrangement of IMF by March 15, 2024 and successful negotiation of a new IMF program.\n\nThe ability of a coalition government to take timely and challenging decisions, especially when different parties make governments in provinces and center, will remain to be a subject matter.\n\nThe current base of the market is driven mostly by a wide range of reasons and improved performance of companies, however, the investors will remain cautious in setting the future direction, until clarity.\n\nThe article does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Business Recorder or its owners",

            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) staged a dramatic turnaround after plunging over 1,450 points in the opening few minutes of trading on Tuesday after it was learnt that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was not onboard with the government\u2019s circular debt plan.\n\nAfter falling below the 60,000 level during the opening hours of trading to hit an intra-day low of 59,613.17 \u2013 a fall of over 1,450 points - the KSE-100 began its recovery.\n\nAt close, the benchmark index settled at 61,226.93, an increase of 161.61 points or 0.26%.\n\nIndex-heavy energy stocks including OGDC, PPL, PSO and SNGP, however, were still in the red.\n\nThe earlier negativity came after the IMF said the interim government\u2019s tariff rationalisation and circular debt management plans do not address the underlying problems of Pakistan\u2019s energy sector.\n\n\u201cRestoring the viability of the energy sector is critical to Pakistan\u2019s economic recovery and fiscal sustainability,\u201d IMF Mission Chief Nathan Porter told Business Recorder via message on Monday.\n\n\u201cFor this, it is essential for the government to focus on broad-based reforms, including to reduce the high cost of energy, improve compliance and reduce theft and line losses, end captive power, and fix the governance and management of the DISCOs, as well as keep up with regular tariff adjustments.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the proposed plan does not address the underlying problems. In particular, the circular debt neutrality of the tariff rationalisation plan is doubtful and it would place a significant additional burden on vulnerable households.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarket was expecting a big dividend due to this,\u201d said Mohammed Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, in a note.\n\nExperts said the market\u2019s downward trajectory was led by OGDC and PPL in addition to political uncertainty that dampened sentiment as formation of a coalition government was seemingly still away from being finalised.\n\nAfter its recovery, an analyst said strong corporate showing is driving the index upwards.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is no positive development on the economic front, strong corporate results are acting as a support factor,\u201d Sana Tawfik, an analyst at AHL, told Business Recorder.\n\nOn the corporate front, Allied Bank Limited posted a profit growth of nearly 95% during 2023, as compared to the preceding year.\n\nMeanwhile, others were of the view that the recovery comes over market expectations of the formation of a coalition government soon.\n\n\u201cThe recovery comes amid hope that soon a coalition government will take charge, and things will be smooth,\u201d Sohail told Business Recorder later during trading.\n\nOn Monday, the wider market had shrugged off a post on Sunday evening by the Petroleum Division, Ministry of Energy with index-heavy OGDC and PPL deep in the red, dragging the KSE-100 with selling pressure also due to political uncertainty after the General Elections.\n\nAt close, the KSE-100 settled at 61,065.31, down 1,878.43 points or 2.98%. This was the lowest closing of the benchmark index since December 27, 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, the rupee registered a marginal increase of 0.01% against the US dollar in the inter-bank market. At close, the local unit settled at 279.31 after a gain of Re0.02 against the greenback, as per the State Bank of Pakistan.\n\nVolume on the all-share index increased to 435.5 million from 350 million a session ago.\n\nThe value of shares rose to Rs15.97 billion from Rs12.74 billion in the previous session.\n\nK-Electric Ltd was the volume leader with 65.8 million shares, followed by WorldCall Telecom with 30.1 million shares, and Pak Refinery with 28.6 million shares.\n\nShares of 355 companies were traded on Tuesday, of which 188 registered an increase, 139 recorded a fall, while 28 remained unchanged.",

            "text": "Allied Bank Limited (ABL) has reported a significant year-on-year growth in its financial performance for the year 2023.\n\nThe bank\u2019s profit after tax surged to Rs41.3 billion, marking a 94.38% increase from the Rs21.25 billion recorded in 2022. This was disclosed in the Financial Results sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday (today).\n\nThis translates to an earnings per share (EPS) of Rs36.07, up from Rs18.56 in the previous year.\n\nIn response to the robust financial results, the Board of Directors at ABL has recommended a final cash dividend of Rs4 per share, which amounts to 40%.\n\nThis comes in addition to the interim dividends already distributed at Rs8 per share, totaling an 80% dividend payout for the year.\n\nA key driver of ABL\u2019s impressive performance has been its net interest income (NII), which rose by 69.26% year-on-year to Rs112.9 billion, up from Rs66.7 billion.\n\nThis increase is largely attributed to a 65.7% rise in interest-earning to Rs357 billion.\n\nThe bank also experienced growth in its total non-markup income, which increased by 19.33% to Rs25.6 billion.\n\nThis was buoyed by a significant 32.3% increase in fee, commission, and brokerage income, reaching Rs11.8 billion.\n\nAdditionally, dividend income and foreign exchange income saw increases of 14.8% and 15.3%, reaching Rs3.5 billion and Rs9.2 billion, respectively.\n\nHowever, ABL reported a 39.7% decrease in gains from the sale of securities, which stood at Rs844.8 million for the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the bank also reported a provision reversal of Rs2.98 billion in 2023, a positive shift from the provision expense of Rs260.9 million in 2022.\n\nOn the expenditure side, total non-markup expenses rose by 19.5% to Rs49.7 billion in 2023, from Rs41.6 billion in the preceding year.\n\nThis increase was primarily due to an 18.5% rise in operating expenses, which climbed to Rs47.7 billion.\n\nAdditionally, contributions to the Workers\u2019 Welfare Fund were also higher during the year.\n\nIn terms of taxation, ABL\u2019s tax payments witnessed a significant increase, totaling Rs45.5 billion, which is 78.2% higher than the previous year\u2019s payments.",

            "text": "After a volatile session at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), strong corporate results helped stocks stage a final-hour rally, pushing the benchmark KSE-100 beyond 62,000 with an over 400-point gain on Thursday.\n\nDuring most part of the day, the benchmark index had remained largely range-bound.\n\nHowever, it picked up traction in the final hour of trading, and at close, the benchmark index settled at 62,393.73, an increase of 414.55 points or 0.67%.\n\nExperts said investor sentiment improved after strong corporate results especially by the index-heavy banking and energy sectors.\n\nShares of index-heavy energy stocks including OGDC and PPL closed in the green alongside scrips of Bank Alfalah and Soneri Bank, which posted significant profit growth.\n\nAt close on Wednesday, the benchmark index retreated amid late selling to close at 61,979.18, an increase of 137.44 points or 0.22%.\n\nExperts said that the market is keenly awaiting the polls, and a rally is expected post-elections.\n\n\u201cThe General Elections 2024 are expected to be held on 8th Feb\u201924, and transition of power to the newly elected government is expected to increase investor confidence in the market,\u201d said Arif Habib Limited (AHL) in a report on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWith the ongoing result season, certain scrips are expected to remain in the limelight on the expectation of robust results,\u201d it added.\n\nPRL posts PAT of over Rs2bn profit in 2QFY24\n\nGlobally, the Asian shares faltered on Thursday after Wall Street took a late spill, while investors stuck to bets for sizable cuts in US interest rates this year even if the kick-off might now be a little later than first hoped.\n\nThe Federal Reserve committee\u2019s decision to hold rates at 5.25-5.5% on Wednesday was no surprise, it took a dovish twist by emphasising that rates would not be cut until it had more confidence that inflation was truly beaten.\n\nIn a media conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell flatly stated a cut as early as March seemed unlikely, but also conceded that everyone on the committee was looking to ease this year.\n\nVolume on the all-share index decreased to 270.5 million from 276.4 million a session before.\n\nThe value of shares increased to Rs11.62 billion from Rs9.27 billion in the previous session.\n\nK-Electric Ltd was the volume leader with 34 million shares, followed by Soneri Bank Ltd with 28.1 million shares, and Pak Refinery at 26.1 million shares.\n\nShares of 346 companies were traded on Thursday, of which 166 registered an increase, 154 recorded a fall, while 26 remained unchanged.",

What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nBOK\u2019s initiative is a crucial component of a wider campaign by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) aimed at curbing illicit activities within the underground market.\n\nThe SBP has recently introduced structural reforms within the exchange company sector to enhance regulatory oversight, bolster governance frameworks, fortify internal controls, and tighten compliance protocols.\n\nFurthermore, the SBP has raised the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional stipulation that the capital must be unencumbered by prior losses.\n\nEarlier, major banks including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), Bank Alfalah (BAFL), Habib Metropolitan Bank, Askari Bank Limited and Bank of Punjab announced their plans to establish their own forex companies.\n\nThe SBP issued no-objection certificate (NOC) to ABL and MCB for establishing their exchange companies. Allied Bank\u2019s exchange company will be named ABL Exchange Company (Private) Limited and MCB\u2019s as MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

            "text": "Escalating regional tension took their toll on investor sentiment at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) as the benchmark KSE-100 index sustained further losses on Thursday.\n\nDuring the opening few minutes of trading KSE-100 index plunged over 1,000 points. By the end of the trading session, the benchmark index had recovered some of its losses to settle at 63,202.40, still a decrease of 364.93 points or 0.57%.\n\nNegativity was witnessed across-the-board with index-heavy sectors including cement, chemical, commercial banks, fertiliser, oil and gas exploration companies, OMCs and power generation trading in the red.\n\nSelling pressure comes as tensions between neighbouring Pakistan and Iran rose to spook investors, said experts.\n\n\u201cInvestors traded with caution due to the ongoing Pak-Iran conflict,\u201d said Capital Stake in its report on Thursday.\n\n\u201cThis morning Pakistan undertook a series of highly coordinated and specifically targeted precision military strikes against terrorist hideouts in Siestan-o-Baluchistan province of Iran,\u201d the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MOFA) said in a statement on Thursday morning.\n\n\u201cA number of terrorists were killed during the Intelligence-based operation \u2013 codenamed \u2018Marg Bar Sarmachar\u2019,\u201d it added.\n\nThe development was Islamabad\u2019s response after Iran conducted a strike inside Pakistani territory which Pakistan said resulted in the death of two innocent children and injured three girls.\n\n\u201cThis violation of Pakistan\u2019s sovereignty is completely unacceptable and can have serious consequences,\u201d said the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement early Wednesday morning.\n\nThe latest strikes add to multiple regional crises amid Israel\u2019s aggression in Gaza and pro-Palestinian Houthis\u2019 attacks on commercial vessels in the Red Sea.\n\nGlobally, Asian shares were off to a tepid start on Thursday, weighed down by a murky economic outlook in China and expectations the global rate easing cycle may not come as early as some had initially thought.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.1%, though it was still languishing near Wednesday\u2019s two-month low of 490.45 points.\n\nThe index had tumbled more than 2% on Wednesday, its steepest one-day percentage fall in more than five months, led by a slump in Chinese stocks after a slew of economic data pointed to a shaky economic recovery in China.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistani rupee registered back-to-back gains against the US dollar, appreciating 0.04% in the inter-bank market on Thursday. As per the State Bank of Pakistan, the local unit closed at 279.98, a gain of Re0.12 against the greenback.\n\nVolume on the all-share index inched up to 445.8 million from 421.3 million a session before.\n\nThe value of shares declined to Rs14.2 billion from Rs18.5 billion in the previous session.\n\nK-Electric Ltd. was the volume leader with 59.7 million shares, followed by P.I.A.C.(A) with 40.4 million shares, and WorldCall Telecom at 35.3 million shares.\n\nShares of 345 companies were traded on Thursday, of which 96 registered an increase, 227 recorded a fall, while 22 remained unchanged.",

            "text": "Driven by improved market sentiment, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) maintained its upward trajectory as the benchmark KSE-100 Index crossed the 58,000 level for the first time in history on Wednesday.\n\nAt close, the KSE-100 settled at 58,198.76, up by 827.17 points or 1.44%.\n\nEarlier at 2:25pm, the benchmark index was hovering at 58,349.56 level, an increase of 977.98 points or 1.70%, which was followed by some profit-taking before the end of the session.\n\nAcross-the-board buying was witnessed, with index-heavy sectors including automobile assemblers, cement, chemical, commercial banks, fertilizer, oil and gas exploration companies and OMCs trading in the green.\n\nOn Tuesday, the benchmark index had gained 294 points or 0.51% to settle at 57,371.59.\n\nThe ongoing bullish trend comes amid the country\u2019s improved economic indicators and the interim government\u2019s successful negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for the first review, which will unlock $700 million in funding.\n\nAnalysts expect that after the review Pakistan will be able to attract further inflows from its other multilateral and bilateral partners.\n\n\u201cOne of the fastest but not unexpected recovery at PSX,\u201d said Mohammed Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, in a post on social media platform X.\n\nThe expert shared that the bourse has delivered a 50% return in USD terms in six months.\n\n\u201cAnd the good thing is\u2026 This recovery has just started. Market PE [price to earning ratio] of 3-4 times still at an unbelievably low levels,\u201d he added.\n\nConvening a meeting of the Donor Coordination Committee (DCC) at the Ministry of Economic Affairs on Tuesday, caretaker finance minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar reported positive signs of economic recovery, expecting GDP growth between 2 to 2.5% in the fiscal year 2024.\n\nShe highlighted that despite external factors impacting Pakistan\u2019s economy, including tightening global financial conditions and rising commodity prices, the successful review of the IMF staff-level agreement was a significant achievement.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistani rupee continued its positive run against the US dollar for the fifth consecutive session as it appreciated 0.23% in the inter-bank market on Wednesday. As per the State Bank of Pakistan, the local currency settled at 285.13, an increase of Re0.66.\n\nVolume on the all-share index decreased to 596.2 million from 1,012.2 million a session before.\n\nOn the other hand, the value of shares increased to Rs22 billion from Rs19.3 billion in the previous session.\n\nWorldCall Telecom remained the volume leader with 50.3 million shares, followed by Fauji Fert Bin with 23.2 million shares and Fauji Foods Ltd with 20.1 million shares.\n\nShares of 389 companies were traded on Wednesday, of which 236 registered an increase, 136 recorded a fall, while 17 remained unchanged.",

            "text": "Rising political volatility took a toll on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) as the benchmark KSE-100 lost over 1.8% during trading on Thursday on account of selling, especially in energy sector stocks.\n\nAt close, the benchmark index settled at 61,020.06, a decrease of 1,133.79 points or 1.82%. Index-heavy stocks including OGDC, PPL and PSO closed deep in the red.\n\nExperts said rising political volatility and its projected impact on the economy of the country is taking a toll on market sentiment.\n\nOn Tuesday, the PSX plunged over 1,450 points in the opening few minutes of trading when it was learnt that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was not onboard with the government\u2019s circular debt plan, but then made a dramatic turnaround.\n\nOn Wednesday, the benchmark index settled with a gain of over 1.5% at 62,153.84.\n\nMoody\u2019s Investors Services (Moody\u2019s), meanwhile, has termed the political uncertainty in Pakistan following inconclusive election results a credit negative.\n\nThe rating agency in its latest report on Pakistan stated that overall, uncertainty around Pakistan\u2019s ability to quickly negotiate a new IMF programme after the current one expires in April 2024 remains very high.\n\nOn the corporate front, PSO posted massive consolidated losses to the tune of Rs10.43 billion in the second quarter of fiscal year 2023-2024 on account of a massive increase in operating and financial expenses.\n\nOn the political front, as per media reports, the Azad Jammu & Kashmir Election Commission issued an arrest warrant for Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) leader Ali Amin Gandapur.\n\nGandapur has been nominated for the chief minister slot of Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa.\n\nGlobally, Asian stocks rose on Thursday, with the Nikkei breaching a new 34-year peak, while the dollar took a breather near a three-month high as markets assess when the Federal Reserve is likely to start its easing cycle after a run of strong economic data.\n\nMSCI\u2019s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.7%, with the IT index surging more than 2%.\n\nEurope\u2019s stock markets opened on the front foot on Thursday after gains elsewhere, despite news that the UK economy has entered an official recession.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistani rupee recorded a marginal decline as it depreciated 0.02% against the US dollar in the inter-bank market on Thursday. At close, the local unit settled at 279.38 after a loss of Re0.06 against the greenback, as per the State Bank of Pakistan.\n\nVolume on the all-share index increased to 345.1 million from 303.9 million a session ago.\n\nThe value of shares declined to Rs11.87 billion from Rs14.68 billion in the previous session.\n\nK-Electric Ltd was the volume leader with 33.32 million shares, followed by P.I.A.C.(A) with 28.6 million shares, and Media Times Ltd with 22.4 million shares.\n\nShares of 344 companies were traded on Thursday, of which 85 registered an increase, 238 recorded a fall, while 21 remained unchanged.",

It has been done by maintaining a tight monetary policy stance to control inflation and to continue to build up foreign exchange reserves.\u201d\n\nIn a key development, Bloomberg News, citing a Pakistani official, reported on Thursday that Pakistan plans to seek a new loan of at least $6 billion from the International Monetary Fund to help the incoming government repay billions in debt due this year.\n\nThe country will seek to negotiate an Extended Fund Facility with the IMF, the report said, adding that the talks with the global lender were expected to start in March or April.\n\nOn Thursday, PSX witnessed a range-bound session, as investors looked for more clarity on both the political and economic fronts, to settle at 61,914.34 level.\n\nGlobally, Asian shares climbed Friday following a day of record highs in Japanese, US and European markets after demand for AI-powering chips drove tech gains.\n\nInvestors celebrated on Thursday as bumper profits reported by US chip giant Nvidia, seen as a bellwether for the artificial intelligence boom, helped boost Tokyo\u2019s benchmark index past a record high set in 1989.\n\nOn the political front, the first session of the Punjab Assembly began on Friday in which the newly-elected lawmakers were administered oath. Moreover, Sindh Assembly\u2019s session is scheduled for tomorrow, where leading party Pakistan People\u2019s Party has nominated Murad Ali Shah again for the Sindh\u2019s CM post.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistani rupee marginally reduced against the US dollar, depreciating 0.01% in the inter-bank market on Friday. At close, the local unit settled at 279.36, a loss of Re0.03 against the greenback, as per the State Bank of Pakistan.\n\nVolume on the all-share index decreased to 377.97 million from 324.83 million a session ago.\n\nThe value of shares increased to Rs16.01 billion from Rs13.96 billion in the previous session.\n\nKohinoor Spining was the volume leader with 36.16 million shares, followed by K-Electric Ltd with 26.53 million shares, and Yousuf Weaving with 16.72 million shares.\n\nShares of 339 companies were traded on Friday, of which 201 registered an increase, 118 recorded a fall, while 20 remained unchanged.",
