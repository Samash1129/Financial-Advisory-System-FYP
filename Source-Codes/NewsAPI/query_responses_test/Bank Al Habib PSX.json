            "text": "Bank AL Habib Limited (BAHL) has announced to set up an exchange company with an initial share capital of Rs 1 billion as disclosed to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday.\n\nThis decision is in accordance with Sections 96 and 131 of the Securities Act, 2015, as well as Clause 5.6.1 (a) of the Rule Book of the Pakistan Stock Exchange.\n\nAccording to the stock filing, the exchange company would be BAHL\u2019s 100 percent-owned subsidiary.\n\nBefore the exchange company can be officially established, it must obtain the necessary approval or clearance from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and fulfill other regulatory compliance requirements, including capital adequacy, governance standards, and operational criteria.\n\nThis development follows the recent crackdown against black market operatives, and the subsequent announcement by the SBP to introduce structural reforms in the exchange companies\u2019 sector.\n\nThe point of the crackdown has been to rein in the open market and strengthen the sector\u2019s governance, internal controls, and compliance culture. As part of these reforms, leading banks actively engaged in foreign exchange business would establish wholly owned Exchange Companies to cater to the legitimate foreign exchange needs of the general public.\n\nAdditionally, the minimum capital requirement for Exchange Companies has been increased from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, free of losses.\n\nIt is pertinent to note that BAHL has now become the fourth major bank to establish an exchange company, as United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank and MCB Bank Limited (MCB) have already decided to set up exchange companies.",

            "text": "KARACHI: The benchmark index of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) reached a significant milestone in the outgoing week as it crossed the psychological barrier of 66,000 points.\n\nArif Habib Ltd said the sentiment remained robust since board meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) is now scheduled for Jan 11. Additionally, Pakistan and Saudi Arabia agreed upon investment modalities during the outgoing week \u2014 a move that\u2019ll pave the way for the signing of a free trade agreement with the Gulf Cooperation Council.\n\nMoreover, petroleum sales witnessed a nine per cent moth-on-month jump in November.

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange on Tuesday rose to one of its highest-ever levels, crossing the psychological barrier of 54,000 points, even if it closed the day lower than yesterday's close.\n\nThe KSE-100 index opened at 53,8860.36 points. Early in the day, the positive momentum from Monday carried over when the index gained over 700 points. As a result, it quickly gained 452.53 points in the opening session as it breached the 54,000-point psychological barrier and surged to an all-time high of 54,312.89 points.\n\nThis is when investors decided to do some profit-taking, driving the index downwards.\n\nThis trend was a prominent feature in the second half of the day, with the index ending in the negative, dropping 577.16 points by day end.\n\nThe index closed at 53,734 level, down 0.23% or 124.63 points compared to Monday's close of 53,860.36 points. This was the first session that ended on a negative note after six consecutive positive sessions. It follows a week where the index rose past the psychological barrier of 53,000 points for the first time in six and a half years.\n\nOn Tuesday, over 505 million shares were traded, worth Rs18.2 billion.\n\nDuring the day, banks, oil marketing companies, exploration and production, power and tobacco sectors contributed negatively as Bank Al Habib (BAHL), Pakistan State Oil (PSO), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), The Hub Power Company Limited (HUBC) and Pakistan Tobacco Company Limited (PAKT) lost 135 points, brokerage TopLine Securities said in their report.\n\nOn the other hand, some stocks like Lucky Cement Limited (LUCK), Colgate-Palmolive Pakistan Limited (COLG) and Engro Fertilizers Limited (EFERT) saw an increase in their stocks with investors buying their stock. They had a combined positive contribution of 160 points.\n\nNotably, CNERGY led the volumes chart with the trading of over 50.4 million shares.\n\nOne reason for the current positive momentum is the hope that the ongoing International Monetary Fund (IMF) review for the next tranche of the Stand-By Arrangement will go through smoothly. The other reason is that despite the positive movement in the bourse, company stock remains available at comparatively lower prices and is thus attracting investment.",

            "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) recorded gains of just 0.4% in the outgoing week as investors awaited the International Monetary Fund (IMF) review and monetary policy announcement next week.\n\nInvestors\u2019 interest was driven by encouraging corporate results, which triggered activity in specific stocks while some results did not meet market expectations, leading to selling pressure.\n\nContinuously depreciating rupee and a significant fall in the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) foreign currency reserves piled pressure on the bourse, which restricted the market\u2019s rapid advance.\n\nAt the beginning of the week, the PSX commenced trading on a robust note as it crossed the psychological barrier of 51,000 points owing to investor confidence aided by easing political uncertainties and positive economic data projections.\n\nHowever, the market lost momentum on Tuesday in a volatile session owing to selling pressure arising from geopolitical tensions and anxiety about the IMF\u2019s review under the $3 billion standby arrangement. On Wednesday, the bourse recovered, driven by earnings announcements and optimism about the IMF review, which would lead to the release of second loan tranche of $700 million.\n\nOn Thursday, the KSE-100 index ended nearly flat in range-bound trading as investors\u2019 spirit weakened over depreciation of Pakistani rupee and the decline in foreign currency reserves.\n\nOn the last day of the trading week, the index suffered losses as bears took the driving seat ahead of the monetary policy announcement and due to the looming uncertainty surrounding talks with the IMF.\n\nThe market closed at 50,944, up 212 points, or 0.42% week-on-week (WoW). In his market review, JS Global analyst Muhammad Waqas Ghani wrote that the KSE-100 index closed the week at 50,944, gaining 0.4% WoW. However, average volumes dropped 10% WoW to 366 million shares.\n\n\u201cAbove-expected earnings/ dividends announcement by Bank AL Habib, Fauji Cement, MCB Bank and Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans triggered activity in these stocks,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other hand, below-expected earnings and dividend announcement by Fauji Fertiliser Company impacted investors\u2019 sentiment and led to a 3.3% WoW decline in the stock\u2019s price. During the week, the auto assemblers announced 2-3% reduction in car prices to account for the recent appreciation of the rupee.\n\nOn the political front, the PML-N supremo returned to Pakistan who cited reduction in government expenditures, increase in tax revenue, rise in exports, IT sector reforms and improving relations with neighbouring countries as top issues on his party\u2019s agenda.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, as the IMF review was approaching fast, the government became more aggressive in pursuing its economic targets and implementing policy measures.\n\nOn a similar note, the ECC approved the much-awaited increase in gas prices while the budget deficit contracted to 0.9% of GDP in 1QFY24 from 1% of GDP during the same period of last year.\n\nPakistan also surpassed its primary surplus criterion set by the IMF, which was reported at 0.4% of GDP for 1QFY24, the JS analyst added. Arif Habib Limited (AHL) commented that the market kicked off trading on a positive note, driven by the approval of gas tariff hike, a significant step towards meeting one of the prerequisites for the IMF\u2019s review scheduled to commence on November 2, 2023.\n\nNotably, the current account deficit was recorded at $8 million for September 2023, down 95% month-on-month. \u201cThe momentum was further bolstered by the results season, which contributed to the positive trajectory,\u201d it said.\n\nHowever, the consistent appreciation of the rupee ended, resulting in the currency closing at Rs280.57 against the greenback, depreciating by Rs1.77, or 0.64% WoW. Moreover, SBP\u2019s reserves decreased $220 million to $7.5 billion, AHL said.\n\nForeigners turned net sellers as they sold stocks worth $3.47 million compared to net buying of $2.32 million last week, AHL added.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, October 29th, 2023.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Conditionalities before the start of the final review with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and uncertainty about the possibility of a rate cut given the Ramazan-driven spike in inflation\n\nkept investors in a jittery mood as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed the outgoing week in the red.\n\nArif Habib Ltd (AHL) said the stock market remained under pressure throughout the outgoing week, primarily due to divided opinions about the upcoming monetary policy decision, alongside the government\u2019s negotiations with the IMF for final review.\n\nConcurrently, the formation of the cabinet and the appointment of Muhammad Aurangzeb as finance minister brought resolution to lingering uncertainties.\n\nAKD Securities Ltd said the additional conditionalities including expanding the tax net, removing specialised tax regimes, reviewing the NFC award, halting gas supply to power producers, and terminating gas subsidies for fertiliser plants all seem to be long-term goals that are put forward by the lender to possibly include in the budget 2024-25 budget.\n\nOn the economic front, according to AHL, the government raised Rs93bn against a target of Rs50bn through Ijarah sukuk, while broad money (M2) increased by Rs496bn to Rs32.7 trillion as of March 1. Additionally, the SBP reserves increased by $17 million to $7.9bn in the week ending on March 8. The rupee appreciated slightly against the US dollar at Rs278.74 gaining 29 paise or 0.11pc week-on-week.\n\nHence, the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed at 64,816 points, down by 977 points or 1.5pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise negative contributions came from fertiliser (215 points), oil & gas exploration (190 points), commercial banks (174 points), oil & gas marketing companies (103 points) and power (55 points). Meanwhile, the sectors which mainly contributed positively were automobile parts (20 points), paper & board (6 points) and chemicals (4 points).\n\nScrip-wise negative contributors were Dawood Hercules (203 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (108 points), Engro Corporation (78 points), Bank Al-Habib Ltd (68 points) and United Bank Ltd (68 points). On the flip side, scrip-wise positive contributions came from Meezan Bank Ltd (62 points), Engro Fertiliser (52 points), Lucky Cement (47 points), Thal Ltd (20 points), and Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd (18 points).\n\nForeign buying continued during the outgoing week, clocking in at $2.7m compared to a net buy of $6.3m last week. Major buying was witnessed in commercial banks ($1.9m) and cement ($1.83m). On the local front, selling was reported by companies ($2.5m) followed by broker proprietary ($1.7m). Average volume dipped 20.1pc to 340m shares while the average value traded witnessed a steep fall of 30.5pc to $41m week-on-week.\n\nAHL said on the successful conclusion of the IMF review, Pakistan would receive the final tranche\n\nof $1.1bn under the current $3bn Stand-By Arrangement. Additionally, the energy minister has emphasised the importance of addressing the energy circular debt, with efforts to expedite its resolution underway any favourable progress in this regard would uplift market sentiment.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 17th, 2024",

The SBP has pledged to institute structural reforms in the exchange company sector, emphasizing the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe primary aim of this crackdown is to enhance oversight of the open market and strengthen governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures within the sector. The minimum capital requirement for exchange companies has been raised from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional requirement that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that Faysal Bank Limited joins the ranks of major banks keen on participating in this transformative shift.

Clear crests and troughs were visible in the index during intraday trade.\n\n\u201cSelling pressure from FIIs and delay in gas circular debt resolution plan have kept investors at bay. We expect the market to remain jittery ahead of general elections where political anxiety is likely to dent investor sentiment based on the news where former prime minister Imran Khan and ex-foreign minister Qureshi have been sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment in the cipher case. We recommend investors to accumulate on dips as we expect the market to rally after the general elections,\u201d said Intermarket Securities Limited.\n\nMore green was visible compared to red in the commercial banks sector during the intraday trade, likely due to projections suggesting an increase in banks\u2019 Net Interest Income (NII).\n\n\u201cThe NII of the banks in its portfolio is likely to increase by 61% YoY to Rs 324 billion in 4Q2023 on the back of a rise in asset yields. 6M Kibor/T-Bill/PIB rates have increased to 21.88%/21.68%/17.26% respectively (up around 300-550bps on a YoY basis) in 4Q2023,\u201d said Topline Securities.\n\nHowever, despite recently declaring its highest-ever profitability, the share price of Bank AL Habib Limited (BAHL) reduced by Rs 0.65.\n\nIn terms of volume, K-Electric was the clear leader with 36,273,372 shares traded.\n\nUnilever Foods\u2019 share price increased by Rs 1551, making it the highest gainer. However, appreciation in Unilever\u2019s stock is easy to predict, especially considering the company\u2019s announcement of an interim cash dividend of Rs 179 per share in last November for FY23, a return on equity of 1790% attracts equity investment.",
