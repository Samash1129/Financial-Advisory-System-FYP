            "text": "In Pakistan\u2019s Rawalpindi, food street comes alive for pre-dawn Ramadan meals\n\nISLAMABAD: In the Pakistani garrison city of Rawalpindi, restaurant and food stall owners are seen making special arrangements around midnight before crowds of people throng the famous Kartarpura food street to fulfill themselves with traditional Pakistani delicacies to get going through a day of fasting during the holy month of Ramadan.\n\nIn the 19th century, the Kartarpura Street was part of Rawalpindi\u2019s Sikh neighborhood and the city\u2019s main commercial area, but over the past few decades it has developed into a food street and become famous for treats such as tender beef or mutton meat with bone marrow, known as nihari, and siri paye, a traditional breakfast dish of cow or goat head and trotters cooked overnight.\n\nDeserts like kheer, kulfi, lassi and refreshing pomegranate and plum drinks attract crowds of food enthusiasts from midnight till dawn during the whole month.\n\n\u201cThis is my first experience here. I had heard a lot about Kartarpura, heard from a lot of people that sehri [pre-dawn Ramadan meal] there is quite special and the breakfast is unique,\u201d said Usman Ahmed, a visitor.\n\n\u201cSo, this is my first time here and my experience has been excellent because there is a lot of variety here, you get different food on different shops with different tastes.\u201d\n\nMany of the food stall owners and vendors in the busy street are not residents of the city, but they come every year from far-flung areas to set up their stalls due to the increased footfall in Ramadan.\n\nSome of these stalls are even set up by established food businesses elsewhere in the country.\n\n\u201cMost people come here because [this] food street is famous and people from Gujranwala, Lahore and other far-flung areas come here to set up food stalls in Ramadan,\u201d said Muhammad Hamza Bhatti, a food vendor.\n\n\u201cPeople know that all sorts of food is available here, that\u2019s why you see the crowds here.\u201d\n\nFew customers, however, complain of the increase in prices which has dampened their spirits this Ramadan.\n\nPakistan, a nation of over 241 million people, is currently reeling from the impact of inflation that hit a historic high of 38 percent in May last year, but eased to 23.1 percent in February this year, still on the higher side mainly due to the high costs of energy and food.\n\n\u201cThis year, there is no rush [here]. These are the people who are on TikTok, making videos and nothing else. Otherwise, there is no rush only due to inflation,\u201d said Muhammad Adnan, another customer.\n\n\u201cInflation has increased to a level you cannot imagine. A bowl that used to cost Rs400 ($1.43) is selling for Rs1,600 ($5.74) to Rs1,800 ($6.45). A single person\u2019s bill is no less than Rs2,000 ($7.17).\u201d\n\nwith inputs from AFP",

            "text": "KARACHI: The government is set to raise Rs150 billion through the auction of one-, three-, and five-year fixed and floating rate local currency Sukuk, or Islamic bonds, at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on February 20.\n\nA trader can be seen at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) building in Karachi. \u2014 PPI/File\n\nThe auction will be held for five denominations of Sukuk: one-year discounted Government of Pakistan Ijarah Sukuk (GIS), three-year variable rate, three-year fixed rate, five-year variable rate, and five-year fixed rate Sukuk, according to an auction calendar issued by the PSX.\n\nMeezan Bank Limited is leading the transaction as a joint financial adviser and Shariah adviser for the issue of Sukuk, along with Dubai Islamic Bank Pakistan, BankIslami Pakistan Limited, and Bank Alfalah Islamic.\n\nThis will be the third issuance through PSX, after successful issuances in December 2023 and January 2024, where the government was able to raise approximately Rs30 billion and Rs80 billion respectively.\n\nThe Sukuk auction will provide investors an opportunity to invest in a Shariah-compliant instrument and earn returns of up to approximately 20 percent with investments as low as Rs5,000 only.\n\nIn contrast to conventional interest-based Treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds, bankers stated that the government is diversifying its funding sources and reducing considerable debt costs with the successful issuance of Sukuk through the local bourse.\n\nAlong with this, there appears to be a shift towards Shariah-compliant financing, after the Federal Shariat Court's directive to remove Riba/interest from the financial system by December 2027.\n\nBankers said the one-year discounted Ijarah Sukuk will be under fresh issuance, while the issuance of three\n\nand five-year variable and fixed rate bonds will be against the reopening of Sukuk issued in the January 2024\n\nauction. This will be the first time a Sukuk will be reopened through auction at PSX.\n\nReopening of Sukuk is similar to that of issuance of a completely new Sukuk, where the transaction is concluded by purchasing additional shares in the identified asset, which is then leased out via a separate Ijarah agreement executed with the government.\n\nIn case of reopening, the investors bid on the purchase price of the Sukuk instead of the rental rate (which is the usual practice), as the rental rate is kept the same as announced for the initial issue, which is being reopened.\n\nThe underlying asset, maturity date, rental rate, and rental payout frequency of the reopened Sukuk are kept the same as that of the initial issue.",

            "text": "The banking sector in Pakistan maintained robust growth in profitability during 2023, including growth in assets and deposits, the high-interest rate regime allowed them to make handsome margins, increase investment in securities, and lend cash to the federal government at exorbitant financing rates.\n\nOn the other hand, they attracted deposits from customers, providing them with handsome returns too. There have also been major transformations and developments in a few commercial banks, which will impact the banking sector positively in the long term.\n\nALSO READ Bank Alfalah Launches Pakistan\u2019s First Digital Payments Sales and Service Centers Focusing on Merchants and Small Businesses\n\nSome of the initiatives taken by different commercial banks will be followed by other competing banks in the near future. Below are a few major developments that happened during 2023:\n\n(1) Faysal Bank\u2019s Conversion to Islamic Bank\n\nFaysal Bank announced its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank on the first day of the calendar year. The bank converted its assets, deposits, operations, branches, and licenses from conventional to Sharia-based banks and became the second-biggest Islamic bank in the banking industry.\n\nThis transition is said to be the biggest conversion of any conventional bank, not only in Pakistan but in the world, considering the size of the operation. The transformation of Faysal Bank also provided a roadmap for other banks seeking to convert their operations from conventional to Islamic.\n\n(2) MCB Bank Acquires 81% Stake in Asset Management Company\n\nMCB Bank acquired an additional 30 percent stake in its subsidiary, MCBAH Savings and Investments, at the cost of Rs. 649 million. Through this deal, the bank received 21.6 million shares, or 30 percent, of another sponsor, Arif Habib Corporation, at a share price of Rs. 30. Hence, its overall shareholding in the subsidiary increased to over 81 percent from 51 percent.\n\nMCB-AH Limited is one of the leading asset management companies in the fund management sector, and a few companies within a sector are also listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The transition in shareholding will strengthen the position of the bank in the financial sector.\n\n(3) JS Bank Acquires Major Shareholding in BankIslami\n\nJS Bank Acquired major shares in BankIslami to convert the Islamic bank into its subsidiary with ownership of the significant shareholding. The bank increased its stakes in the Islamic bank by 75 percent by purchasing shares from the parent financial entity, JS Group.\n\nThe share swap deal was successful between the sponsors of the Islamic bank, despite being challenged in the Sindh High Court. JS Bank maintained a different strategic position, which will increase its profitability and influence in the banking industry after this deal.\n\n(4) Prominent Banks Plan for Conversion to Islamic Banking\n\nProminent conventional banks with a separate division of Islamic banking announced their plans for full-fledged conversion to Islamic Banking in light of a verdict issued by the Federal Shariat Court last year.\n\nThe banks included the Bank of Punjab, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, and Summit Bank. In this regard, the Bank of Punjab hired a consultant, and Summit Bank rebranded itself as Mukramah Bank. This transition in banking operations will likely attract different conventional banks to follow the same suit.\n\nALSO READ Financial Irregularities Worth Rs.14 Billion Allegedly Uncovered During PSL Audit\n\n(5) Bank Alfalah Acquires Stakes in QistBazaar\n\nBank Alfalah acquired 7.2 percent stakes in BNPL QistBazaar at a cost of Rs. 140 million. The deal can be a win-win situation for both entities in scaling up their business and profitability.\n\nIn addition to the equity agreement, Bank Alfalah, and QistBazaar signed an embedded financing agreement in Shariah-compliant mode for up to Rs. 350 million. Accordingly, the bank will incorporate digital financing products within the QistBazaar platform to offer embedded consumer durables financing in BNPL\u2019s mode.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s move to invest in QistBazaar can prove a stepping stone to strengthening the fintech landscape of the country, as more banks are likely to follow suit for collaboration and investment in fintech companies, which is the need of the hour.\n\n(6) Major Banks to Set up Exchange Companies\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) plans to streamline the business of foreign exchange across the country with control and regulation on trade and flows of foreign currencies, mainly to monitor the stability of the rupee against the dollar. In this regard, the banking industry watched as various exchange companies in Category B shut down while commercial banks were allowed to establish their foreign exchange subsidiaries as an alternate option in the financial sector.\n\nAn overwhelming number of banks made announcements to set up subsidiaries of foreign exchange, including HBL, UBL, MCB, Bank Al Habib, Meezan Bank, Habib Metro Bank, Askari Bank, etc.\n\n(7) Summit Bank Receives Investment from UAE\n\nSummit Bank received a significant capital injection of Rs. 10 billion from its sponsor and prominent UAE investor, Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah.\n\nThe investor subscribed to 3.98 billion new shares of the bank at Rs. 2.51 per share, becoming the major shareholder in the bank. Moreover, Summit Bank plans to convert its entire operation from a conventional banking system to an Islamic one, similar to Faysal Bank. Its board of directors also approved a three-year conversion plan, and the bank has been renamed Bank Makramah Limited\n\n(8) Silk Bank Attracts Investors\n\nSilk Bank, once again, sought the financial support of a strong investor on a long-term basis to fulfill its regulatory requirements of paid-up capital and the sustainability of its profitable operations.\n\nThe bank has attracted interest from MCB Bank, United Bank Limited, International Commercial Bank of South Sudan, and Pakistan Housing Finance Company for investment and merger. At present, these financial institutions are carrying out the due diligence of the bank, which is showing the increasing competition among these entities in striking a deal with Silk Bank.\n\nSudanese Bank and Pakistan Housing Company even expressed their investment plans of 50 million euros and Rs. 12 billion, respectively. With four proposals in hand, it is a good time for Silk Bank to say yes to at least one institution with remarkable experience in local industry and operating a subsidiary.\n\nALSO READ State Bank Fails to Satisfy Panel in Rs. 70 Billion Money Laundering Scandal\n\n(9) Meezan Bank Collaborates to Launch Islamic Microfinance Services\n\nMeezan Bank took the initiative to collaborate with SAFCO Microfinance Company Private Limited (SMCL) for the launch of Islamic microfinance services in the low-income segment of society.\n\nThis is the first time that a commercial bank has significantly supported a microfinance institution. The leading Islamic bank has committed to providing Rs. 100 million in financing and technical support for product development, capacity building, and training for the microfinance company.\n\nThe step will further accelerate the penetration of Islamic banking across the country. The microfinance company established its inaugural Islamic microfinance branch under the brand name \u2018Yaqeen\u2019 in Hyderabad, Pakistan.\n\n(10) HBL to Set Up a Specialized Agri Subsidiary\n\nHabib Bank Limited received approval from the State Bank of Pakistan to set up a specialized subsidiary for the agriculture sector. The subsidiary will work to provide financial access to farmers and other players in the agriculture sector, particularly, but the institution has plans to be deeply involved in the sector\u2019s development.\n\nThe leading bank previously carried out different projects successfully in this sector, which gave it the confidence to enhance its footprints in the food sector with a much bigger role and a long-term profitable engagement. The out-of-box approach of the bank\u2019s leadership might give it a competitive edge in the industry.",

            "short_description": "In a first, Pakistan unlocks Islamic bond market for retail investors with Ijarah Sukuk launch  Arab News Pakistan",
            "text": "KARACHI: In a groundbreaking development, the Pakistani government on Friday unlocked the Islamic bond market for retail investors through an auction of the country\u2019s first-ever sovereign Ijarah Sukuk at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), aiming to raise Rs30 billion ($105.8 million).\n\nSukuk is an Islamic financial certificate that represents ownership in a tangible asset or a pool of assets. It is similar to a bond but is structured in a way that complies with Islamic law, which prohibits interest-based transactions.\n\nIn connection with the launch of the first Ijarah Sukuk a \u2018gong ceremony\u2019 was held at the PSX in Karachi, which was attended by Caretaker Prime Minister Anwaar-ul-Haq Kakar and Finance Minister Dr. Shamshad Akhtar.\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony, PM Kakar said the promotion of the auction was a collective responsibility of the Exchange Pakistan Stockbrokers Association, Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan and all other market participants.\n\n\u201cYour participation will contribute to making this event a remarkable achievement for the entire market ecosystem,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, as we ring the gong, we herald not just market transactions, but a symphony of progress and prosperity.\u201d\n\nPM Kakar said this gong sound echoed across financial corridor of the nation and signaled commitment for fostering robust ecosystem.\n\n\u201cIt signals our commitment to fostering an inclusive and robust financial ecosystem, one that welcomes diverse voices and ensures that the benefits of economic prosperity are shared by all,\u201d he said.\n\nAbout the current state of the Pakistan stock market, which continues to scale new highs, the prime minister said the investors regained their confidence after his government's successful signing of a $3 billion standby agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), execution of the Financial Year 2024 budget, and improvements in fiscal and external accounts.\n\n\u201cThis bullish sentiment was possible due to the improved economy and especially the participation of foreign investors due to low price earnings ratio, high dividend yield and stabilized exchange rate, pushing the KSE hundred to surge to 40% since early September, reaching an unprecedented level,\u201d he said.\n\nThe tenure of Ijarah Sukuk, issued by Pakistan Domestic Sukuk Company Limited through the finance ministry, is one year that will mature on December 09, 2024. The face value of a Sukuk is Rs5,000 ($17.6), according to a PSX document.\n\nJoint financial and Shariah advisers for the issuance of the bond include Meezan Bank Limited, Dubai Islamic Bank (Pakistan) Limited, Bank Islami Pakistan Limited and Bank Alfalah Limited.\n\nThe federal government plans to raise an overall Rs90 billion ($315 million) with three Ijarah Sukuk auctions. The second auction is scheduled for January 23, 2024 and the third for February 20, 2024, according to the PSX auction calendar.\n\nPakistani financial experts said the launch of government debt securities at the stock market would enhance the investor base and allow common investors to benefit from the issuance.\n\n\u201cThe auction gives PSX investors the chance to invest, contributing to a more diverse investor base,\u201d said Shahid Ali Habib, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Karachi-based Arif Habib Limited brokerage house.\n\n\u201cThe move also promises a substantial boost to the Islamic capital market in Pakistan.\u201d\n\nHabib said the issuance will help in developing Islamic capital market in the country and will encourage more investors to look for interest free avenues.\n\nExperts also believe the auction has ended the monopoly of big banks who would earlier take part in the auctions.\n\n\u201cThe Sukuk would now be in the access of common investor as compared to the past practice where only big banks or mutual fund would invest,\u201d Ali Nawaz, CEO of Chase Securities, told Arab News.\n\nNawaz said investors now would be able to avail entire profit of their investment, without the involvement of any intermediaries.",
