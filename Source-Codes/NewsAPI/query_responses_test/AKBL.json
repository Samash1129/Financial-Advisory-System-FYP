            "text": "KARACHI: The equities market turned in a robust performance in the first outgoing week of the new calendar year thanks to positive developments on the economic front.\n\nArif Habib Ltd said the stock market displayed notable resilience, experiencing a significant surge of 2,211 points on Monday, recording the second-highest absolute point increase and marking the highest surge on the first working day of a new year.\n\nMoreover, positive economic indicators were evident as the Federal Board of Revenue achieved a historic one-month tax collection of Rs984bn, coupled with a substantial 40.1 per cent year-on-year reduction in the trade deficit for December 2023. However, an elevated level of headline inflation number of December at 29.7pc year-on-year raised some investor concerns.\n\nOn a positive note, the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s reserves reached $8.2bn, the highest level since July 14, 2023. Moreover, the rupee strengthened by 0.16pc against the US dollar, clocking in at Rs281.4.\n\nHence, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,515 points after gaining 2,064 points or 3.3pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise positive contributions came from oil and gas exploration companies (587 points), commercial banks (392 points), fertiliser (315 points), cement (185 points), and power generation and distribution (166 points). Sectors that contributed negatively were miscellaneous (13 points), glass & ceramics (3.2 points), investment banks (1.3 points), modarbas (one point) and leasing companies (0.1 points).\n\nScrip-wise positive contributors were Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (268 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (258 points), Fauji Fertiliser Company (151 points), Hub Power Company Ltd (120 points), and United Bank Ltd (102 points). Meanwhile, scrip-wise negative contributions came from Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans Ltd (12 points), Askari Bank Ltd (6 points), Ghani Glass Ltd (4.8 points), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (4.5 points), and BankIslami Pakistan Ltd (3.6 points).\n\nForeign selling clocked in at $3.1m compared to $1.9m in the preceding week. Major selling was witnessed in exploration and production ($1.95m) and banks ($1m).\n\nOn the local front, buying was reported by other organisations ($5.5m) and banks ($5.4m). Average daily volume arrived at 687m shares, up by 5.4pc week-on-week. The average daily value settled at $69.6m, up by 11.6pc from the preceding week.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd observed that the surge in the benchmark KSE 100-share can largely be attributed to aggressive institutional buying after the IMF announced its executive board is meeting on Jan 11 to approve $700m tranche for Pakistan.\n\nGoing forward, AKD Securities Ltd said the market is anticipated to maintain its bullish momentum, fuelled by the disbursement of the IMF second tranche. The forthcoming elections will be closely watched, and uncertainty surrounding their outcome could potentially hinder the market\u2019s bullish trend.\n\nHowever, a peaceful resolution could provide a significant boost to investor confidence. Our recommendation to investors is to maintain long-term positions in companies with strong fundamentals while tactfully managing any fundamentally weak entities through a timely profit-taking strategy.\n\nAdditionally, companies offering robust dividend yields, especially in the banking, energy, and fertiliser sectors, present opportunities for accumulation, noted AKD Securities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2024",

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "Pakistan\u2019s stock market witnessed a lackluster week as trading volumes dropped by 25% and the benchmark KSE-100 Index lost 1.27% of its value.\n\nAccording to a note by AKD Research, average trading volumes remained down by 24.7% week-on-week, clocking in at 312.8 million shares, compared to 415.8 million shares traded in the past week.\n\nThe market was mainly influenced by news events in the energy sector, such as the hike in fuel prices and the conflict in the Middle East.\n\nInvestors also awaited the outcome of the monetary policy committee (MPC) meeting and the inflation data for January. The MPC decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 22%, citing the possibility of future easing as real interest rates are expected to stay positive for the next 12 months.\n\nThe inflation rate for January came in at 28.34%, slightly lower than AKD Research\u2019s forecast of 28.63%, but still very high compared to the regional and global averages.\n\nThe inflation was driven by the increase in energy and food prices, which offset the impact of the appreciation of the Pakistani rupee against the US dollar. The rupee ended the week at Rs 279.41 against the US dollar, up 0.07% from the previous week.\n\nThe country\u2019s foreign exchange reserves declined by $55 million to $8.22 billion, as Pakistan requested China for a $2 billion debt rollover to ease its external financing pressures.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) also lowered its GDP growth projection for Pakistan to 2% for the current fiscal year, citing the challenges of inflation and fiscal consolidation.\n\nThe Karachi interbank offered rate (Kibor) increased to 22%, reflecting the tight liquidity conditions in the banking system.\n\nAmong the sectors, exchange traded funds and transport were the top performers, gaining 5.7% and 3.2% respectively, while automobile parts & accessories, chemical and oil marketing companies were the worst performers, losing 7.4%, 6.9% and 5% respectively.\n\nThe major net sellers in the market were foreigners, who offloaded $9.7 million worth of shares, while the major net buyers were insurance companies, who purchased $7.0 million worth of shares.\n\nThe top performing companies in the KSE-100 Index were Millat Tractors, Oil and Gas Development Company, Unity Foods, MCB Bank and Askari Bank, while the top losing companies were Younus Brothers, Pakistan Tobacco Company, Colgate-Palmolive, K-Electric and Punjab Oil Mills.\n\nThe brokerage firm forecasted that the next week is uncertain, as the market will be overshadowed by the upcoming elections, which are expected to reduce the participation and activity of the investors.\n\nHowever, after the elections, the market may regain some momentum, especially if the government manages to implement the circular debt settlement plan and the industrial tariff rationalisation plan, which are pending the approval of the IMF.\n\nAKD Research maintained a bullish outlook on the banks, exploration and production, and oil marketing companies, as they offer potential for earnings growth and attractive dividend yields.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Despite strong corporate results and better performance on the external front, the political and law and order issues continued driving investor sentiments who preferred to take profit in the outgoing week ahead of the general elections on Feb 8.\n\nThe share market opened the week on a negative note as the benchmark KSE 100-share index suffered the highest day-on-day loss of 1,040 points since Dec 26, 2023, ahead of the announcement of the monetary policy statement in the evening.\n\nOn Tuesday it extended the overnight gloomy trend and dropped by 931 points falling below the 62,000 level after PTI founder and former prime minister Imran Khan and his foreign minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi were handed down a 10-year jail term in a cipher case. In the last three sessions, the index resumed its recovery drive on the back of positive economic numbers.\n\nArif Habib Ltd said the stock market remained depressed due to political noise coupled with uncertainty related to circular debt resolution.\n\nAdditionally, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the benchmark policy rate unchanged at 22 per cent in the monetary policy committee meeting held on Jan 29. Furthermore, the headline inflation slightly eased to 28.3pc in January from 29.7pc in December.\n\nIn addition to this, the trade deficit for January contracted by 25pc year on year to $1.9bn. Meanwhile, the SBP\u2019s reserves dropped by $54m, reaching $8.2bn. During the week rupee closed at 279.41 against the greenback strengthing by 0.07pc week-on-week.\n\nOil sales fell 13pc in July-January FY24, petrol price was raised by Rs13.55 per litre and development funds were cut by Rs114bn.\n\nHence, the market closed at 63,003 points after declining 810 points or 1.3pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise negative contributions came from fertiliser (181 points), oil & gas marketing companies (130 points), chemical (121 points), technology and communication (86 points) and power generation & distribution (66 points).\n\nMeanwhile, the sectors which mainly contributed positively were automobile assembler (88 points), cable & electrical goods (7 points), insurance (7 points), and pharmaceuticals (3 points). Scrip-wise negative contributors were Colgate-Palmolive (Pakistan) Ltd (105 points), Mari Petroleum Ltd (94 points), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (80 points), Engro Fertilisers Ltd (77 points) and PSO (64 points). Meanwhile, scrip-wise positive contributions came from Oil and Gas Development Company (122 points), Millat Tractors Ltd (80 points), MCB Bank Ltd (78 points), Bank Alfalah Ltd (22 points) and Askari Bank Ltd (8 points).\n\nForeign selling continued during the outgoing week, clocking in at $9.7m compared to a net sell of $22.7m last week. Major selling was witnessed in commercial banks ($2.7m) and cement ($2.2m). On the local front, buying was reported by insurance companies ($7m) followed by broker proprietary trading ($1.5m). Average volume dipped by 24.7pc to 313m shares while the average value traded plunged 43.2pc to $41m week-on-week.\n\nAccording to AKD Securities Ltd, the trading next week will be overshadowed by general elections and market participation is expected to remain subdued.\n\nFollowing the successful completion of the elections, the market is anticipated to gain momentum. Furthermore, the circular debt settlement and industrial tariff rationalisation plans, if they pass through the International Monetary Fund are likely to boost investors\u2019 confidence.\n\nPublished in Dawn, February 4th, 2024",

            "short_description": "Here's What Happened in Pakistan's Banking Sector in 2023  ProPakistani",
            "text": "The banking sector in Pakistan maintained robust growth in profitability during 2023, including growth in assets and deposits, the high-interest rate regime allowed them to make handsome margins, increase investment in securities, and lend cash to the federal government at exorbitant financing rates.\n\nOn the other hand, they attracted deposits from customers, providing them with handsome returns too. There have also been major transformations and developments in a few commercial banks, which will impact the banking sector positively in the long term.\n\nALSO READ Bank Alfalah Launches Pakistan\u2019s First Digital Payments Sales and Service Centers Focusing on Merchants and Small Businesses\n\nSome of the initiatives taken by different commercial banks will be followed by other competing banks in the near future. Below are a few major developments that happened during 2023:\n\n(1) Faysal Bank\u2019s Conversion to Islamic Bank\n\nFaysal Bank announced its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank on the first day of the calendar year. The bank converted its assets, deposits, operations, branches, and licenses from conventional to Sharia-based banks and became the second-biggest Islamic bank in the banking industry.\n\nThis transition is said to be the biggest conversion of any conventional bank, not only in Pakistan but in the world, considering the size of the operation. The transformation of Faysal Bank also provided a roadmap for other banks seeking to convert their operations from conventional to Islamic.\n\n(2) MCB Bank Acquires 81% Stake in Asset Management Company\n\nMCB Bank acquired an additional 30 percent stake in its subsidiary, MCBAH Savings and Investments, at the cost of Rs. 649 million. Through this deal, the bank received 21.6 million shares, or 30 percent, of another sponsor, Arif Habib Corporation, at a share price of Rs. 30. Hence, its overall shareholding in the subsidiary increased to over 81 percent from 51 percent.\n\nMCB-AH Limited is one of the leading asset management companies in the fund management sector, and a few companies within a sector are also listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The transition in shareholding will strengthen the position of the bank in the financial sector.\n\n(3) JS Bank Acquires Major Shareholding in BankIslami\n\nJS Bank Acquired major shares in BankIslami to convert the Islamic bank into its subsidiary with ownership of the significant shareholding. The bank increased its stakes in the Islamic bank by 75 percent by purchasing shares from the parent financial entity, JS Group.\n\nThe share swap deal was successful between the sponsors of the Islamic bank, despite being challenged in the Sindh High Court. JS Bank maintained a different strategic position, which will increase its profitability and influence in the banking industry after this deal.\n\n(4) Prominent Banks Plan for Conversion to Islamic Banking\n\nProminent conventional banks with a separate division of Islamic banking announced their plans for full-fledged conversion to Islamic Banking in light of a verdict issued by the Federal Shariat Court last year.\n\nThe banks included the Bank of Punjab, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, and Summit Bank. In this regard, the Bank of Punjab hired a consultant, and Summit Bank rebranded itself as Mukramah Bank. This transition in banking operations will likely attract different conventional banks to follow the same suit.\n\nALSO READ Financial Irregularities Worth Rs.14 Billion Allegedly Uncovered During PSL Audit\n\n(5) Bank Alfalah Acquires Stakes in QistBazaar\n\nBank Alfalah acquired 7.2 percent stakes in BNPL QistBazaar at a cost of Rs. 140 million. The deal can be a win-win situation for both entities in scaling up their business and profitability.\n\nIn addition to the equity agreement, Bank Alfalah, and QistBazaar signed an embedded financing agreement in Shariah-compliant mode for up to Rs. 350 million. Accordingly, the bank will incorporate digital financing products within the QistBazaar platform to offer embedded consumer durables financing in BNPL\u2019s mode.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s move to invest in QistBazaar can prove a stepping stone to strengthening the fintech landscape of the country, as more banks are likely to follow suit for collaboration and investment in fintech companies, which is the need of the hour.\n\n(6) Major Banks to Set up Exchange Companies\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) plans to streamline the business of foreign exchange across the country with control and regulation on trade and flows of foreign currencies, mainly to monitor the stability of the rupee against the dollar. In this regard, the banking industry watched as various exchange companies in Category B shut down while commercial banks were allowed to establish their foreign exchange subsidiaries as an alternate option in the financial sector.\n\nAn overwhelming number of banks made announcements to set up subsidiaries of foreign exchange, including HBL, UBL, MCB, Bank Al Habib, Meezan Bank, Habib Metro Bank, Askari Bank, etc.\n\n(7) Summit Bank Receives Investment from UAE\n\nSummit Bank received a significant capital injection of Rs. 10 billion from its sponsor and prominent UAE investor, Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah.\n\nThe investor subscribed to 3.98 billion new shares of the bank at Rs. 2.51 per share, becoming the major shareholder in the bank. Moreover, Summit Bank plans to convert its entire operation from a conventional banking system to an Islamic one, similar to Faysal Bank. Its board of directors also approved a three-year conversion plan, and the bank has been renamed Bank Makramah Limited\n\n(8) Silk Bank Attracts Investors\n\nSilk Bank, once again, sought the financial support of a strong investor on a long-term basis to fulfill its regulatory requirements of paid-up capital and the sustainability of its profitable operations.\n\nThe bank has attracted interest from MCB Bank, United Bank Limited, International Commercial Bank of South Sudan, and Pakistan Housing Finance Company for investment and merger. At present, these financial institutions are carrying out the due diligence of the bank, which is showing the increasing competition among these entities in striking a deal with Silk Bank.\n\nSudanese Bank and Pakistan Housing Company even expressed their investment plans of 50 million euros and Rs. 12 billion, respectively. With four proposals in hand, it is a good time for Silk Bank to say yes to at least one institution with remarkable experience in local industry and operating a subsidiary.\n\nALSO READ State Bank Fails to Satisfy Panel in Rs. 70 Billion Money Laundering Scandal\n\n(9) Meezan Bank Collaborates to Launch Islamic Microfinance Services\n\nMeezan Bank took the initiative to collaborate with SAFCO Microfinance Company Private Limited (SMCL) for the launch of Islamic microfinance services in the low-income segment of society.\n\nThis is the first time that a commercial bank has significantly supported a microfinance institution. The leading Islamic bank has committed to providing Rs. 100 million in financing and technical support for product development, capacity building, and training for the microfinance company.\n\nThe step will further accelerate the penetration of Islamic banking across the country. The microfinance company established its inaugural Islamic microfinance branch under the brand name \u2018Yaqeen\u2019 in Hyderabad, Pakistan.\n\n(10) HBL to Set Up a Specialized Agri Subsidiary\n\nHabib Bank Limited received approval from the State Bank of Pakistan to set up a specialized subsidiary for the agriculture sector. The subsidiary will work to provide financial access to farmers and other players in the agriculture sector, particularly, but the institution has plans to be deeply involved in the sector\u2019s development.\n\nThe leading bank previously carried out different projects successfully in this sector, which gave it the confidence to enhance its footprints in the food sector with a much bigger role and a long-term profitable engagement. The out-of-box approach of the bank\u2019s leadership might give it a competitive edge in the industry.",

            "text": "The Bank of Punjab announced on Monday that its board was proposed the establishment of a wholly-owned Exchange Company (EC).\n\nThe development was shared by the bank in its notice to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX).\n\n\u201cIn view of the recently introduced structural reforms by State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in the EC\u2019s sector and challenges posed by the recent depreciation in Pakistani rupee in the open market, leading banks have been encouraged to establish wholly owned ECs with an authorized capital of Rs2.5 billion,\u201d said BoP.\n\n\u201cAccordingly, in view of the current market potential and future expansion needs, an initial feasibility report for the establishment of \u2018BOP Exchange Company\u2019 was proposed to the Board of The Bank of Punjab in its meeting held on October 28, 2023,\u201d read the notice.\n\nThe bank said that the establishment of an EC is subject to approval from SBP and compliance with relevant laws and regulations.\n\nLast month, the SBP, in its bid to strengthen controls amid the massive fall in the rupee\u2019s value in the open market, decided to introduce \u2018structural reforms\u2019 in the EC sector.\n\nSince then, many banks have announced they would establish an EC as a wholly-owned subsidiary: Askari Bank, Habib Metropolitan Bank, Bank Alfalah, Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), Bank Al Habib Limited (BAHL), MCB Bank Limited, Meezan Bank Limited and United Bank Limited (UBL).\n\nThe SBP has also raised the minimum capital requirement for EC from Rs200 million to Rs500 million, raising the barrier to entry for the private sector.",
