This was disclosed in the Financial Results sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday (today).\n\nThis translates to an earnings per share (EPS) of Rs36.07, up from Rs18.56 in the previous year.\n\nIn response to the robust financial results, the Board of Directors at ABL has recommended a final cash dividend of Rs4 per share, which amounts to 40%.\n\nThis comes in addition to the interim dividends already distributed at Rs8 per share, totaling an 80% dividend payout for the year.\n\nA key driver of ABL\u2019s impressive performance has been its net interest income (NII), which rose by 69.26% year-on-year to Rs112.9 billion, up from Rs66.7 billion.\n\nThis increase is largely attributed to a 65.7% rise in interest-earning to Rs357 billion.\n\nThe bank also experienced growth in its total non-markup income, which increased by 19.33% to Rs25.6 billion.\n\nThis was buoyed by a significant 32.3% increase in fee, commission, and brokerage income, reaching Rs11.8 billion.\n\nAdditionally, dividend income and foreign exchange income saw increases of 14.8% and 15.3%, reaching Rs3.5 billion and Rs9.2 billion, respectively.\n\nHowever, ABL reported a 39.7% decrease in gains from the sale of securities, which stood at Rs844.8 million for the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the bank also reported a provision reversal of Rs2.98 billion in 2023, a positive shift from the provision expense of Rs260.9 million in 2022.\n\nOn the expenditure side, total non-markup expenses rose by 19.5% to Rs49.7 billion in 2023, from Rs41.6 billion in the preceding year.\n\nThis increase was primarily due to an 18.5% rise in operating expenses, which climbed to Rs47.7 billion.\n\nAdditionally, contributions to the Workers\u2019 Welfare Fund were also higher during the year.\n\nIn terms of taxation, ABL\u2019s tax payments witnessed a significant increase, totaling Rs45.5 billion, which is 78.2% higher than the previous year\u2019s payments.",

On the flip side, Mari Petroleum, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank, Habib Bank and Bank Alhabib Ltd lost value to weigh down on the index by 226 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 63,813.06 points after shedding 484.94 points or 0.75 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume further dipped by 10.39pc to 412.82 million shares.

            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange on Thursday made a new record as it crossed the psychological barrier of 67,000 points.\n\nThe index started the day at its highest-ever closing point of 66,547.78 points, which it had attained on Wednesday.

The index is up 61% from July 2023 and 12% in the last three months.\n\nContinuing the positive momentum from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme, economic reforms led by the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC), progress on selling off the national flag carrier, Pakistan International Airlines (PIA), and other loss-making state-owned enterprises, hike in gas tariffs, all contributed towards investor confidence.\n\nInvestors strategically augmented their equity portfolios by acquiring blue-chip stocks across diverse sectors. Power, banking, and fertilizer sectors positively influenced the index, with Bank AL Habib Limited (BAHL), Engro (ENGRO), Muslim Commercial Bank (MCB), Pakistan Petroleum Limited (PPL), and Lucky Cement (LUCK) collectively contributing 208 points to the bourse which gained a cumulative 594.34 points.\n\nSimultaneously, profit-taking was observed in Systems Limited (SYS), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), and Service Industries Limited (SRVI), resulting in a cumulative loss of 31 points.\n\nBrokerage house Topline Securities said that Thursday's trading session saw robust activity, with over 421.02 million shares exchanged at the bourse, amounting to a total value of Rs16.1 billion.

            "text": "ABL announced earnings (PAT) today for the calendar year 2023 at Rs. 41.3 billion, depicting an increase of 94 percent YoY | 8 percent QoQ.\n\nAccording to Arif Habib Limited, this jump in overall earnings was mainly on the back of growth in total income. Along with the result, ABL announced a final dividend of Rs. 4/share (CY23: Rs. 12/share).\n\nALSO READ MSCI Adds 22 PSX Companies to Its Indices\n\nNet Interest Income of the bank settled at Rs. 32.3 billion during 4QCY23, increasing 52 percent YoY and 7 percent QoQ. With this, the total NII for CY23 went up to Rs. 112.9 billion, marking a 69 percent YoY jump.

This jump in CY23 is primarily due to higher fee, FX, and dividend income which were up 32 percent YoY, 15 percent YoY, and 15 percent YoY, respectively. However, the gain on securities declined by 40 percent YoY during the same period, clocking in at Rs. 845 million.\n\nProvisioning for the bank clocked in at Rs. 445 million during 4QCY23 (4QCY22: Rs. 436 million) depicting an increase of 2 percent on a YoY basis. This takes total provisioning to Rs.~3 billion during CY23 (CY22 reversals: Rs. 261 million).\n\nThe bank\u2019s OPEX increased 6 percent YoY in 4QCY23 clocking in at Rs. 12.4 billion (4QCY22: Rs. 11.7 billion). With this, Cost/Income stood at 30.8 percent in 4QCY23 against 45.3 percent same period last year.\n\nThe effective tax rate was set at 57 percent during 4QCY23 compared to 50 percent last quarter. With this, the effective tax for CY23 stood at 52 percent (CY22: 55 percent).",

            "text": "KARACHI \u2013 The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has imposed heavy fine on Allied Bank Limited and three others for violating the rules and regulations.\n\nA statement issued by the central bank\u2019s Banking Supervision Department said fines worth Rs83.157 million has been imposed on all the four banks.\n\nIt said the banks were found guilty of breaching the standards of Know Your Customer (KYC), foreign exchange, and general banking operations.\n\nIt added that the penalties were based on deficiencies in the compliance of regulatory instructions and did not reflect the financial soundness of the entities.\n\nIn August this year, the SBP has imposed a fine of Rs16.578 million on Allied Bank Limited for violating the regulatory instructions pertaining to General Banking Operations. It has advised the bank to improve its internal processes in order to avoid violations in the future.\n\nAllied Bank continued to commit regulatory violations among other commercial banks, prompting a response from Pakistan\u2019s central bank.\n\nThe document, available with Pakistan Observer, revealed that the State Bank of Pakistan has slapped a penalty of Rs20 million on Allied Bank for failure to comply with rules.\n\nSBP, in its recent move, found weaknesses in ABL\u2019s system and the failure of other commercial banks to undertake extensive remedial actions against the violations.\n\nAllied Bank had been advised to improve internal processes and controls by the banking regulator as SBP pointed out serious violations including failures in Customers Due Diligence (CDD) and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures, as well as non-compliance with regulations pertaining to asset quality.\n\nThe central bank has also been taken such actions against ABL in the past.\n\nIn 2019, State Bank imposed over Rs60 million on Allied Bank for violating its regulations. ABL was directed by the central bank to conduct an internal inquiry on breaches of regulatory requirements and to take disciplinary action against delinquent officials.\n\nFurthermore, the Supreme Court of Pakistan imposed a fine on ABL President for evading the court hearing in a case filed by bank pensioners. The plaintiff maintained that ABL never raised the pensions of the retired officers in the last decades nor made any contributions to the petitions\u2019 accounts.\n\nThe country\u2019s top court then directed senior officials of Allied Bank to uphold the moral standards while dealing with the people who worked, their whole lives for the bank.\n\nFor the unversed, Allied Bank came into being in 1975 after the merger of a few banks amid nationalization; its predecessor was Australasia Bank.\n\nThe ABL officials have declined to comment on the development.",

            "text": "Allied Bank Limited (ABL) posted its yearly financial results for CY23, declaring a final cash dividend of Rs4/share \u2013 taking the full-year payout to Rs12/share. The after-tax profits almost doubled year-on-year, despite an effective tax rate in excess of 50 percent. Volumetric expansion in asset base, improved deposit mix, and higher interest rates \u2013 all contributed towards the 92 percent year-on-year increase in after-tax profits.\n\nThe markup income soared 66 percent year-on-year, largely on the back of high variance in the average policy rate. Advances growth has been slow across the industry, given the overall macroeconomic situation \u2013 as evidenced by a 10 percent dip in gross advances over December 2022, by the end of September 2023. The ADR had dipped to under 45 percent by September end of 2023 and is likely to have stayed thereabouts, as one awaits the full-year balance sheet details.\n\nMost banks have resorted to improvement in deposit mix \u2013 in a bid to counter the cost of deposits in the face of the rising policy rate. ABL had reported an increase of 12 percent in deposit base to over Rs1.7 trillion as of September end, 2023. The current account growth outpaced all other categories \u2013 as the current account to total deposit inched up to 41 percent, and CASA went past 81 percent. The average cost of deposits is believed to have grown at a lesser pace than that of an increase in policy rate \u2013 owing to improved deposit mix.\n\nNon-funded income soared by a healthy 18 percent year-on-year, led by strong growth in fee and commission income. Foreign exchange income and dividend income also grew appreciably from last year. On the other hand, administrative expenses were kept largely in check at just 19 percent. This speaks volumes of the investment in efficient systems made in yesteryears by ABL \u2013 that seem to now be reaping the fruit \u2013 as the growth in administrative expenses stayed well below the average inflation rate for the year. The cost-to-income ratio, as a result, has improved significantly by over 10 percentage points \u2013 paving the way for a mammoth 84 percent year-on-year growth in pretax profit.\n\nPakistan\u2019s economy may well have come out of the rut and the worst may well be behind us \u2013 but nothing so far suggests a huge shift in fortune for the better \u2013 in 2024. The political stalemate and a very weak coalition government in the making \u2013 are already indicating hard times ahead. Not that ABL has relied heavily on private sector advances to seek profits, as other avenues remain conducive enough for record profits \u2013 year after year.",

            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) staged a dramatic turnaround after plunging over 1,450 points in the opening few minutes of trading on Tuesday after it was learnt that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) was not onboard with the government\u2019s circular debt plan.\n\nAfter falling below the 60,000 level during the opening hours of trading to hit an intra-day low of 59,613.17 \u2013 a fall of over 1,450 points - the KSE-100 began its recovery.\n\nAt close, the benchmark index settled at 61,226.93, an increase of 161.61 points or 0.26%.\n\nIndex-heavy energy stocks including OGDC, PPL, PSO and SNGP, however, were still in the red.\n\nThe earlier negativity came after the IMF said the interim government\u2019s tariff rationalisation and circular debt management plans do not address the underlying problems of Pakistan\u2019s energy sector.\n\n\u201cRestoring the viability of the energy sector is critical to Pakistan\u2019s economic recovery and fiscal sustainability,\u201d IMF Mission Chief Nathan Porter told Business Recorder via message on Monday.\n\n\u201cFor this, it is essential for the government to focus on broad-based reforms, including to reduce the high cost of energy, improve compliance and reduce theft and line losses, end captive power, and fix the governance and management of the DISCOs, as well as keep up with regular tariff adjustments.\n\n\u201cIn our view, the proposed plan does not address the underlying problems. In particular, the circular debt neutrality of the tariff rationalisation plan is doubtful and it would place a significant additional burden on vulnerable households.\u201d\n\n\u201cMarket was expecting a big dividend due to this,\u201d said Mohammed Sohail, CEO of Topline Securities, in a note.\n\nExperts said the market\u2019s downward trajectory was led by OGDC and PPL in addition to political uncertainty that dampened sentiment as formation of a coalition government was seemingly still away from being finalised.\n\nAfter its recovery, an analyst said strong corporate showing is driving the index upwards.\n\n\u201cAlthough there is no positive development on the economic front, strong corporate results are acting as a support factor,\u201d Sana Tawfik, an analyst at AHL, told Business Recorder.\n\nOn the corporate front, Allied Bank Limited posted a profit growth of nearly 95% during 2023, as compared to the preceding year.\n\nMeanwhile, others were of the view that the recovery comes over market expectations of the formation of a coalition government soon.\n\n\u201cThe recovery comes amid hope that soon a coalition government will take charge, and things will be smooth,\u201d Sohail told Business Recorder later during trading.\n\nOn Monday, the wider market had shrugged off a post on Sunday evening by the Petroleum Division, Ministry of Energy with index-heavy OGDC and PPL deep in the red, dragging the KSE-100 with selling pressure also due to political uncertainty after the General Elections.\n\nAt close, the KSE-100 settled at 61,065.31, down 1,878.43 points or 2.98%. This was the lowest closing of the benchmark index since December 27, 2023.\n\nMeanwhile, on Tuesday, the rupee registered a marginal increase of 0.01% against the US dollar in the inter-bank market. At close, the local unit settled at 279.31 after a gain of Re0.02 against the greenback, as per the State Bank of Pakistan.\n\nVolume on the all-share index increased to 435.5 million from 350 million a session ago.\n\nThe value of shares rose to Rs15.97 billion from Rs12.74 billion in the previous session.\n\nK-Electric Ltd was the volume leader with 65.8 million shares, followed by WorldCall Telecom with 30.1 million shares, and Pak Refinery with 28.6 million shares.\n\nShares of 355 companies were traded on Tuesday, of which 188 registered an increase, 139 recorded a fall, while 28 remained unchanged.",

The SBP is implementing structural reforms in the exchange company sector to strengthen oversight, governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures.\n\nThe SBP has also increased the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the added condition that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nBank Alfalah joins several major banks, including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), and Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), in their pursuit to establish their own forex companies.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

            "text": "In early September, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) made a decisive move, signalling that it had had enough. It unfurled a sweeping set of reforms targeting exchange companies. These reforms were not just about tightening the reins on the open market; they were a strategic endeavour to bolster governance, enhance internal controls, and elevate compliance standards to new heights.\n\nThe SBP\u2019s actions were fueled by apprehensions that exchange companies were failing to provide foreign currency to customers when it was available while also carrying out off-the-books transactions, resulting in substantial disparities between interbank rates and those offered by these companies.\n\nUnder the umbrella of these structural reforms, the SBP has given exchange companies three months to increase their paid-up capital and consolidate into a single category. It has also \u201cencouraged\u201d top banks to open exchange companies (more on that later).\n\nThe burning question is: What does this mean for the currency markets \u2014 is the central bank simply trying to rein in illegal activity and increase oversight of the open market, or does it plan to eventually phase out the open market completely?\n\nBefore the reforms\n\nThere are two legal currency markets in Pakistan: the interbank market which is made for and participated in by banks, and the open market which comprises exchange companies. According to the Standby Agreement signed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in June, the difference in the rates cannot exceed 1.25% for more than five consecutive days.\n\nThis is because the central bank intervened in the interbank market in the past, including last year, to control the rupee\u2019s depreciation by imposing an artificial cap on the dollar to rupee exchange rate. This makes imports cheaper and exports expensive, leading to a widening trade deficit and pressure on foreign exchange reserves. The IMF believes the open market is more difficult to coerce and so, by demanding that the rates align closely with each other, it was hoping the interbank rate would remain closer to the market reality.\n\nHowever, between August 28 and September 4, the difference in the market rates widened to an alarming extent both in absolute and percentage terms. For instance, on September 1, the interbank rate was Rs 305.46 per dollar while the open market rate was Rs 333 \u2014 a difference of Rs 27.54 per dollar or 8.27%. It appeared that the open market, which is less heavily regulated, was out of control. This is when multiple agencies launched a crackdown on illegal foreign exchange trade. They ramped up monitoring, placed officials at certain branches and raided offices of exchange companies suspected of being involved in conducting \u201coff-the-books\u201d deals that added to the exchange rate volatility. Consequently, the exchange rate started dropping from a high of Rs 334 on September 4. At the time of writing (September 28), the open market rate stands at Rs 289 per dollar. [You can read further details of the crackdown in Profit\u2019s September 11-17 issue].\n\nThe new structural reforms\n\nThe crackdown was followed by structural reforms unveiled on September 6. Under these reforms, the SBP encouraged leading banks actively engaged in the foreign exchange business to establish wholly owned exchange companies to cater to the legitimate needs of the public.\n\nThere are two categories of exchange companies, A and B. According to the SBP, there are 27 category A exchange companies of which two are subsidiaries of banks \u2014 Habib Bank Limited (HBL) Currency Exchange (Pvt.) Ltd. and National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) Exchange Company (Pvt.) Ltd. There are also 21 category B exchange companies. Additionally, there are also franchises.\n\nPreviously, exchange companies in category A had a higher minimum capital requirement \u2014 Rs 20 crore \u2014 while those in category B had a lower minimum capital requirement of Rs 2.5 crore. The latter could only act as money changers.\n\nUnder the reforms, all exchange companies in categories A and B along with franchises of exchange companies will be consolidated and transformed into a single category with a well-defined mandate.\n\nThe minimum capital requirement for exchange companies for category A has been bumped up from Rs 20 crore to Rs 50 crore, free of losses.\n\nCategory B exchange companies have been given three options: merge with an existing exchange company, upgrade to full exchange company status, or consolidate with other category B exchange companies to form a unified entity. They must approach the SBP within one month for a no-objection certificate (NOC) for one of these choices. After receiving the NOC, they have three months to meet regulatory and legal requirements for formal licensing, failing which, their licences will be cancelled.\n\nMeanwhile, franchises of exchange companies have been offered two options: either merge with the franchiser exchange company or sell the franchise to it. In either case, the franchises will have one month to approach the central bank for approval of the merger or sale. If they do not, their licences will be cancelled.\n\nThe goal of the reforms\n\nProfit spoke to three treasury officials from three leading banks, and two officials of a bank-owned exchange company to understand what necessitated the reforms and what the SBP hopes to achieve.\n\n(We will refer them as treasury official 1, 2 and 3)\n\nTreasury official 1 said the SBP and the law enforcement agencies involved in the recent crackdown had \u201cordered\u201d the top 10 banks to open exchange companies. While the NBP and HBL already had exchange companies, Meezan Bank Limited, Allied Bank Limited, Habib Metropolitan Bank, Bank Alfalah Limited, Faysal Bank Limited, Askari Bank Limited and Bank Al Habib Limited were also ordered to set them up. The orders \u201ccame from the very top\u201d, the source said. Many of these banks have already made announcements in this regard.\n\nIn the coming months, exchange companies in category B will cease to exist and those in category A will find it very difficult to continue operating due to higher capital requirements and punishments for minor infractions, the treasury official said. Most exchange companies are small businesses whose profits come primarily from \u201coff-the-books dealings\u201d, and they are very hard for the SBP to regulate. This is why the central bank wants them to be phased out and replaced by larger, more regulated exchange companies led by banks, he commented.\n\nAccording to treasury official 1, the SBP has directed banks to send letters of intent within one month, assuring them that licences would be granted within the next three months. These banks would then have between 10-12 months to set up at least 10 branches, or separate booths in existing branches, dedicated to foreign exchange dealings. The banks would also have internal oversight of these exchange companies.\n\n\u201cThe market will eventually be heavily regulated and banks will handle the know-your-customer requirements much better than the existing exchange companies. Walk-in customers will also be allowed to sell or purchase foreign currencies provided they have the correct documentation, including possibly tax returns for higher amounts. The purpose of [these reforms] is to ensure that all foreign exchange dealings are done cleanly, legally and on the books.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, treasury official 2 recalled that when incumbent caretaker finance minister Shamshad Akhtar was the SBP governor, she came up with the ideology of \u2018big five banks\u2019 \u2014 those \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d.\n\nThe idea is that when your paid-up capital is high, you have a significant financial investment in the business. Consequently, you cannot afford to engage in any wrongdoing because you have a substantial stake in the company. For example, if your capital is only Rs 2.5 crore, it may not make much of a difference. However, if you are required to invest Rs 50 crore, the paradigm shifts, the scale increases, and the business becomes much more professional. In such a scenario, you can no longer afford to engage in questionable activities or operate without proper adherence to regulations.\n\nMoreover, the problem with category B exchange companies and franchises is that compliance controls have regrettably shown a tendency to be less stringent. This, understandably, raises red flags for the regulatory authorities, particularly in light of their commitment to meeting the rigorous standards set forth by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF).\n\nTherefore, to strengthen control and compliance, the regulator and the government want to phase out category B exchange companies and franchises. And the regulator has taken this job very seriously. In less than a month, the central bank has suspended or revoked the licences of four exchange companies.\n\nProfit reached out to the SBP\u2019s Exchange Policy Department for more clarity on its plans but an interview could not be arranged at the time of writing.\n\nThe results so far\n\nThe effects of the agencies-backed administrative measures and the resulting sentiment-driven market forces are already visible. The rupee has fallen below the Rs 300 mark in both the interbank and open markets and the premium is within the IMF-mandated range.\n\nThe rupee\u2019s appreciation is also gradual this time around, instead of volatile. It has also been very consistent, around Rs1-1.50 daily. This suggests that the recovery of the rupee is being managed in a very controlled manner, and for good reason.\n\nBecause there is excess supply of dollars in the interbank, the SBP purchases these at a certain rate (Rs1-1.50 below the previous day\u2019s closing rate) every day to remove that liquidity from the market and arrest any further weakening of the dollar during that day\u2019s trading. What happens as a result is that the USD/PKR does not drop by too much during any particular day.\n\nFor example, on Monday the market closed at 290/292. The following day on Tuesday, there is an inflow of exports and inward remittances that is well above the amount of imports and outward remittances. This means that banks cannot fully offset these inflows against their outflows and will therefore have to sell dollars in the interbank.\n\nMost banks these days are facing the same predicament and therefore the interbank is flush with supply of dollars, and if left unchecked, such liquidity can cause the dollar value against rupee to fall considerably. So what the SBP does is that it enters the interbank market and buys up this liquidity at 289.50/290.50, Rs 1.50 less than the previous day\u2019s closing rate. By doing this, it sort of mops up the excess dollars at a rate below the previous day\u2019s lowest rate. This restricts any major downward dollar movement in a single day.\n\n\u201cWhile the central bank is looking to take the USD/PKR down to a certain level, it does want to do that too rapidly as it would not only irk exporters but also encourage importers to open more LCs and those \u2018dollar investors\u2019 to start buying and hoarding again if the rate goes too low too fast\u201d, explained treasury official 1.\n\nFollowing the rupee\u2019s appreciation, exporters have rushed to bring back their export proceeds [they tend to hold their proceeds or payments abroad if they expect the rupee will depreciate and they will get more Rupees; under SBP rules, the time limit for bringing export proceeds back is 120 days]. They have booked forward proceeds amounting to $1 billion so far, according to treasury official 1.\n\nLet\u2019s say that an exporter has sold clothes worth $10 million dollars to its buyer in the US. The exchange rate on the day that he sends out his shipment \u2014 called spot or ready rate \u2014 is Rs 288. He is set to receive payment for his export in two months. However, he expects the rupee to appreciate further in that time, which means he could possibly be getting Rs 278 per dollar. To protect himself from the appreciation, he goes to a bank to book forward proceeds. The bank offers him a premium of Rs 1.5 per dollar. This essentially means that the exporter has agreed to sell his dollar proceeds (due at a later date) to the bank today, at a rate of Rs 289.5 per dollar. [There is a downside to this \u2013 the rupee may depreciate in the coming two months and he may lose money instead. If, for example, the spot rate two months later is Rs 290, he will have lost 50 paise per dollar.]\n\nExporters across the country have repeated this process multiple times. This indicates that they expect the rupee will continue to appreciate, at least in the short term. This is why the maximum period of these export forwards is just two months as opposed to six months; this recovery, in exporters\u2019 view, is not going to last more than a few weeks.\n\nHow have exchange companies reacted?\n\nThe mood among exchange companies is far from content. The recent decision to grant banking licences for exchange companies has rattled the industry, sparking strong resistance. Exchange firms view the entry of banking giants into their domain as an existential threat, with their very survival hanging in the balance.\n\nProfit spoke to Malik Bostan, chairman of the Exchange Companies Association of Pakistan (ECAP) and Zafar Paracha, general secretary of ECAP.\n\nParacha expressed his concerns bluntly, stating, \u201cThe way things are, it seems that exchange companies might be forced to shut down. If the government believes that the private sector should not exist, they should inform us, and we will close our business. The SBP doesn\u2019t even need to provide us with a roadmap.\u201d\n\nBostan lamented the crackdown on exchange companies, asserting that every sector has its \u201cblack sheep\u201d, and tarnishing the reputation of all exchange companies is unwarranted.\n\nParacha expressed his views on having the currency exchange business owned by banks. \u201cThis model will fail,\u201d Paracha put it bluntly. He argued that shutting down exchange companies could pave the way for the rise of an informal market or \u201cgrey market\u201d for foreign exchange, which would be more prone to manipulation.\n\nBostan also asserted that banks have a history of manipulating exchange rates, alleging instances where banks purchased dollars from exchange companies and subsequently charged customers higher rates, artificially inflating the dollar rates. This underscores apprehensions regarding the potential consequences of sidelining exchange companies in the foreign exchange landscape.\n\nAccording to Bostan, bank-owned exchange companies haven\u2019t seen much success.\n\nHow have banks reacted?\n\nIn a swift response to the central bank\u2019s recent reforms, United Bank Limited wasted no time in announcing its venture into the exchange company arena on September 12, six days after the reforms were rolled out. UBL\u2019s move triggered a domino effect, with a lineup of other banks swiftly joining the fray. Meezan Bank Limited joined the list three days later. In the following weeks, more banks followed suit which included MCB Bank Limited, Bank AlHabib Limited, Allied Bank Limited, and Faysal Bank Limited. HBL and NBP already had an exchange subsidiary as mentioned earlier.\n\nAn official from a bank-owned exchange company that Profit spoke to stated \u201cthis was long overdue\u201d, \u201clogical\u201d and a \u201cpositive development\u201d. He also added that they see the exchange companies and the banking sector from a treasury perspective coalescing together.\n\nAre bank-owned exchange companies lucrative?\n\nWhile speaking to Profit, both Bostan and Paracha claimed that the banks have not been successful in the exchange company business.\n\nAn official from a bank-owned exchange company disclosed that \u201cthey hardly make any revenues\u201d. He added that \u201cwe have maintained a conservative position\u201d. However, their return on equity exceeds 22%.\n\nWe also looked at the financial statements of the NBP Exchange Company. In 2022, it recorded the highest-ever return on equity of more than 30%.\n\nWhat about the new entrants? Will they be just as successful? According to treasury official 3, it is very likely that exchange companies of banks will be successful. He cited two reasons for this \u2014 first, the foreign exchange business is generally a lucrative one because banks (and exchange companies) usually have customers on both sides of the trade and they earn from the spread in both transactions, and second, better management of cash flow positions. In addition, the costs will be lower for banking exchange companies as they would be operating out of the current existing branches of the banks and most of the required hardware and software would already be present in the branch, he commented.\n\nBusiness model of a bank-owned exchange company\n\nOne of the primary sources of revenue for the bank-owned exchange company is the standard spread of buy and selling rates. These rates are set by the ECAP daily, typically at 1%. This spread serves as a limited source of income.\n\nThe other source is through positioning. The SBP permits category A exchange companies to maintain a portion of their paid-up capital in foreign exchange. This means that they can hold up to 50% of their capital in foreign currencies. This provision enables these companies to actively engage in currency trading. When the value of the dollar increases, they can generate gains due to their currency positions.\n\nConversely, if the dollar\u2019s value decreases, the exchange companies resort to reducing their position by selling the greenbacks to banks\u2019 treasury to minimise potential losses.\n\nOne of the most significant expenses incurred by the exchange company is related to Cash in Transit. The company purchases various foreign currencies like riyal, dirham, pounds, euros, and damaged cash dollars received at its counters, consolidating them at central locations \u2014 typically Karachi, Lahore, or Islamabad, depending on flight availability. These physical currencies are then sold in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, with the proceeds converted into dollars and deposited into the exchange company\u2019s NOSTRO accounts (these are essentially dollar accounts held with foreign banks).\n\nOriginally, electronic dollars in these accounts were used for settling credit card payments. However, the game changed in June when the SBP granted banks the authority to purchase US dollars from the interbank market for settling cross-border card-based transactions. As a result, the exchange company now sells various currencies, including dollars, to banks and individuals for this purpose.\n\nElectronic dollars aren\u2019t just sitting around, though. They are also withdrawn from NOSTRO accounts and handed out as physical cash to individuals. Moreover, these electronic greenbacks are used for settling imports and conducting treasury operations with other banks, being transferred to other banks\u2019 NOSTRO accounts as needed for various financial transactions.\n\nWill banks dominate the currency exchange business?\n\nLet\u2019s break it down: Imagine you\u2019re running a franchise or a category B exchange company, and suddenly, you\u2019re told to take your capital from a modest Rs 2.5 crore to a whopping Rs 50 crore in just three months. Realistically, that\u2019s a tall order, and for many, it\u2019s a challenge they might struggle to meet.\n\nSo, what happens next? Well, category B exchange companies and franchises would either merge or be forced to shut down. This would leave a gap in the market. To bridge this gap, regulators have encouraged banks to step in and play a role in this space.\n\nDoes this mean that only banks will remain in the exchange business? The short answer is no.\n\nAn official of a bank-owned exchange company told Profit that it is premature to assume that banks will outright dominate the landscape of exchange companies at this juncture. Instead, the vision is one of coexistence, where both bank-owned exchange companies and other category A players operate on a level playing field.\n\nMoreover, if we look through the lens of paid-up capital \u2013 currently, there\u2019s a club of 27 category A exchange companies, and interestingly, just two of them are bank-owned. Now, here\u2019s the fascinating part: the majority of these category A companies boast capital ranging from a substantial Rs 50 crore to an impressive Rs 1 billion.\n\nWhat does this mean in the grand scheme of things? It\u2019s a clear sign that the exchange company sector won\u2019t be exclusive territory for banks, as some market sentiments may have suggested.\n\nHowever, bank-owned or not, all category A exchange companies have to follow stringent conditions if they want to keep operating.\n\nThe survival of these businesses teeters on their ability to navigate this regulatory maze. One standout requirement demands an unrelenting 24/7 recording of transactions. These recordings encompass both audio and video footage of personnel working at the exchange counters. Companies must maintain recordings for the past six months, readily accessible at any given moment. Failure to comply with this crucial provision can result in a suspension of transaction privileges at their counters. Adding to the scrutiny, audits conducted by the SBP include meticulous examination of these recordings. The SBP cross-references recordings with transactions, demanding explanations in cases where discrepancies emerge.\n\nMoreover, conducting currency exchange transactions beyond the registered place of business is now strictly off-limits unlike in the past when one could ring up an exchange company and a company representative would deliver currency to your location or office.\n\nThe emphasis is crystal clear: only those companies meticulously adhering to compliance processes will be permitted to continue operations.\n\nWill the open market phase out?\n\nThe future of the open market and its potential convergence with the interbank market has been a subject of curiosity since banks have been rapidly establishing exchange companies.\n\nWhile some questions persist, here\u2019s what three insiders shared with Profit.\n\nAccording to an official of a bank-owned exchange company, the open market is expected to continue to exist. However, there\u2019s a crucial caveat: it will continue to exist within the framework of rules and regulations mandated by the government and regulators, something that it was not made to do very diligently by the regulator in the past. Therefore it will take some getting used to.\n\nTreasury official 3 elaborated on this, emphasising that the foreign currency cash market and the interbank market are distinct entities. While it\u2019s expected that rates will converge and the cash foreign currency market\u2019s volatility will diminish, they won\u2019t become identical. This disparity stems from various additional costs inherent to cash market transactions. One notable cost is the cost of cash in transit which arises when cash foreign currency is transferred to the NOSTRO account of the bank.\n\nConversely, Bostan believes that the gap between the open market rate and the interbank rate could potentially widen. This divergence is expected because people may choose to refrain from bringing foreign exchange into the market.\n\nWill these actions be enough?\n\nThe net result of all of this are some very encouraging news reports of the Pakistani Rupee being on its way to claim the \u2018best-performing currency title in September\u2019. That is all well and good but this thumping victory of the rupee over the dollar must be taken with a little more than a pinch of salt.\n\nYes, these gains are impressive, but are they sustainable? As we have mentioned in our previous articles, all the measures being taken are administrative in nature and they have created a sentiment in the market that the rupee will continue to make strides against the greenback, but only to a point.\n\nThe interim federal minister for industries Gohar Ejaz, who also happens to represent the largest representative body for exporters, APTMA, feels the dollar will bottom out at 260. Others feel it will be 250. But from that point onwards there will be a gradual move in the opposite direction.\n\nWhy? Because our fundamentals remain intact and unchanged. We have to make loan repayments in dollars and we have to import oil, in dollars, both of which are major outflows. And while these are being taken care of by exporters rushing to sell their dollars at the moment, there will come a point, not too long from now, that these proceeds will dry up. We are after all a net importer of goods and services.\n\nAdditionally, a weaker dollar means our exports have become expensive and therefore, there will be shrinkage in volumes as booking deals with foreign buyers will become more difficult. As far as remittances go, the rupee amounts will be getting lower as the dollar weakens in the coming weeks, so perhaps some people hold off on those as well for a bit.\n\nAdd to this the fact that a lot of export proceeds that were going to be coming in after two months and add supply to the interbank have already been factored into the market as exporter have book forwards in droves (almost $1 billion we are told). So a slight recovery by the dollar within 60 days will coincide with very little export proceeds coming in, thereby putting added pressure on the rupee-dollar parity and possibly on the current account deficit as well.\n\nThe policy to move exchange company business from the under regulated \u2018fast and loose\u2019 open market to the over regulated banking industry may not be very well liked by the open market, but it is somewhat necessary. And even though banks are not very keen on doing this, one thing is for sure, they will make it work financially for themselves and play within the confines of the SBP regulations. This will introduce much-needed formality to the currency exchange market.\n\nBut let us not fool ourselves. The vulnerabilities of our currency market remain intact. And once tested again, they will become very visible, very quickly. It remains to be seen what the \u2018shot-callers\u2019 do then.",
