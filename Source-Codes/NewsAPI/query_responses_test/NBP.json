            "text": "The National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) branch building can be seen. \u2014 NBP website\n\nKARACHI: National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), one of the country's largest lenders, on Thursday posted a 72 percent surge in annual profit after tax, driven by a sharp rise in interest income.\n\nNBP reported a profit after tax of Rs53.32 billion for the calendar year 2023, up from RS30.95 billion in the previous year, according to a notice sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Earnings per share rose to Rs24.96 from Rs14.49, the bank said, adding that its board did not recommend any cash dividend.\n\nThe bank attributed the strong performance to a nearly 104 percent increase in mark-up/return earned, which reached Rss1,025.13 billion in 2023, compared to Rs503.58 billion in 2022.\n\nThe net mark-up/return earned jumped 45 percent to Rs169.36 billion, while its fee and commission income rose 7 percent to Rs24.14 billion.\n\nThe foreign exchange income, however declined 7 percent to Rs7.7 billion , and its operating expenses increased 20 percent to Rs95.45 billion.\n\nThe NBP also recorded a 294 percent gain on securities of Rs4.42 billion, and a Rs227 percent increase in share of profit from joint venture and association of Rs1.47 billion.\n\nThe profit before tax stood at Rs103.3 billion, up 62 percent from the previous year. Maintaining its leading market position, the bank achieved Rs6.5 trillion milestone in its balance sheet that grew 27 percent to reach Rs6,652.7 billion from Rs5,240.4 billion at the end of 2022,\" NBP said in a statement. \"This makes NBP the largest bank in Pakistan in terms of total assets.\"\n\nThe statement said bank's board \"deliberated at length whether or not cash dividend should be recommended\". \"However, the likely impact of the pension case and other contingencies, still remains a cause of concern for the board. Accordingly, the board considered it prudent to retain the profits for the time being and once the position becomes clearer, the bank may consider declaration of dividend at a later stage.\"\n\nIMC posts 88.6 percent profit rise despite sales slump\n\nIndus Motor Company Limited (IMC), the maker of Toyota cars in Pakistan, reported an 88.6 percent jump in profit after tax for the six months ended December 31, 2023, despite a sharp drop in sales and production due to weak demand and supply chain disruptions.\n\nThe company posted a profit after tax of Rs4.96 billion #, up from Rs2.63 billion in the same period a year earlier, according to a statement issued on Thursday.\n\nThe net sales turnover decreased by 41.4 percent to Rs50.91 billion, as compared to Rs86.83 billion for the same period last year. The company's overall market share for the quarter stood at 18 percent.\n\nThe earnings per share of the company for the half year ended December 31, 2023, was Rs63.07, in comparison to of Rs33.43 in the same period last year.\n\nThe board of directors declared a second interim cash dividend of Rs13.20 per share. This is in addition to the first interim cash dividend of Rs24.5 per share already paid.\n\nThe combined sales of CKD and CBU vehicles decreased by 61 percent to 7,324 units compared to 18,672 units sold in the previous year. Vehicle production too decreased by 66 percent to 6,391 units as compared to 18,562 units produced in the same period last year.\n\nThe decline in production was mainly due to weak consumer demand and vendor supply chain limitations, which led to regular plant shutdowns during the period, the company said.\n\n\"The country's economy continues to grapple with high fiscal deficit, sky rocketing inflation and power tariff hikes. Customer traffic at dealerships remained lackluster, owing to several factors, such as higher duties and taxes, high interest rates, low auto financing availability and relatively dampened consumer purchasing power,\" IMC Chief Executive, Ali Asghar Jamali, said in the statement.\n\nHe added that supply chain challenges continued to adversely affect the auto sector, as a consequence of which, it operated at below 30 percent production capacity, the lowest in the last decade, leading to forced frequent plant shutdowns.\n\nJamali also said that the company faced challenges in maintaining a level playing field within the automotive sector due to consistent rise in duties and taxes for locally manufactured vehicles while on the other hand, the government relaxed the import and taxation regime for used cars, thereby emphasizing the need for fair competition.\n\n\"Despite all the challenges, I am hopeful that with the new government in place, the country and the overall business environment shall well be on its path to stability, In Sha Allah,\" he said.\n\nSPL posts 122 percent jump in half-year profit\n\nSecurity Papers Limited (SPL) reported a 122 percent surge in its net profit for the first half of the financial year ending December 31, 2023, boosted by higher sales and improved margins.\n\nThe company said its profit after tax rose to Rs746 million, or Rs12.59 per share, in the six months ended June 30, 2023, from Rs336 million, or Rs5.67 per share, in the same period last year. Its revenue increased by 38 percent to Rs3.49 billion from Rs2.53 billion a year earlier.\n\nThe company's gross profit margin improved to 28 percent from 19 percent in the same period last year, as its cost of sales grew by 26 percent to Rs2.51 billion from Rs1.99 billio.\n\nSPL chairman Mohammad Aftab Manzoor attributed the strong performance to the company's strategic focus on operational efficiency and cost reduction, as well as the positive impact of several reforms introduced in the company.\n\n\u201cOur strategic vision and relentless focus on new initiatives and diversification has more than doubled the EPS of the company. The SPL\u2019s strong performance is a testament to its commitment to progress aimed at delivering value to shareholders and customers,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nManzoor also expressed confidence in the future prospects of the company, citing a recently signed technical consultancy agreement with a leading European security paper company that will help SPL benchmark its operational efficiencies and prepare comprehensive efficiency and cost improvement plans. The company also announced an interim cash dividend of Rs2.5 per share.",

            "text": "The share of Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) in monthly new business premium (NBP) in the life insurance sector declined to 58.50 per cent in September 2023 from 68.25 per cent in September 2022 -- a drop of 975 basis points -- owing to shortcomings in the product and distribution side of business.\n\nHowever, the market share saw a marginal uptick from the 57.37 per cent recorded in August this year.\n\nAccording to the monthly business data released for September 2023 by the Life Insurance Council, the NBP of LIC up to September 2023 stood at Rs 92,462.62 crore as compared to about Rs 1.25 trillion in the same period a year ago.\n\nAs a result, the life insurance industry\u2019s NBP declined almost 13 per cent during the first six months to about Rs 1.59 trillion.\n\nLower sales of participating products and lack of competitive non-participating products, along with the changes made to product features and pricing, have led to the decline in the market share of LIC, said insurance analysts.\n\nMeanwhile, the share of private life insurers saw a steady increase to 41.50 per cent in September 2023 from 31.75 per cent in September 2022.\n\nAmong private life insurers, the market share of HDFC Life Insurance in NBP rose to 8.31 per cent from 6.07 per cent and that of SBI Life Insurance to 10.27 per cent from 7.19 per cent.\n\nICICI Prudential Life Insurance, Bajaj Allianz Life Insurance, and Max Life Insurance saw a near less than 1 per cent increase in their market share from September 2022.\n\nAccording to the Annual Report 2022-23, the state-owned life insurer had 16 participating products, 20 non-participating products, 11 group products, and eight riders. Of the new policies generated in this period, 94.39 per cent of the policies were participating products and 5.61 per cent of policies were non-participating products.\n\nMeanwhile, on the distribution side, higher dependence on agent-led networks for selling policies, instead of bancassurance and other alternative methods, is impeding growth in premium.\n\nAnalysts expect growth in life insurance premium to be driven mainly by the country\u2019s large section of young population who depend more on digital services to choose their insurance policies. Persisting reliance on traditional methods will affect the premium. In addition, the higher commission structure of agents also affects the profit margins of LIC.\n\nDuring 2022-23, more than 96 per cent of LIC\u2019s first-year premium was generated through agents and insurance advisors. On the other hand, the major private insurers -- SBI Life Insurance Company and HDFC Life Insurance Company -- generated only 18 per cent and 20 per cent, respectively, of their business through agents.\n\n\u201cDigital initiatives of private insurers to enhance customer service have provided them an edge over LIC. This includes the ease of taking on board customers and agents through digital solutions, real-time tracking of claims as well as virtual meetings with customers to resolve their queries,\u201d said Manogna Vangari, insurance analyst, GlobalData.",

Along with the quarterly results, the company's board will also consider an interim dividend payout to shareholders.The new business premium (NBP) during the third quarter is expected to fall 6% year-on-year to Rs 48,811 crore, and the annualised premium equivalent (APE) is seen dropping 9% year-on-year, according to YES Securities.The value of new business (VNB) is also likely to fall 8% year-on-year to Rs 1,841 crore in the quarter ended December.The growth assumptions are based on trends observed till November 2023, when LIC had displayed NBP and APE growth of 7% and -11%, respectively for October and November 2023.YES Securities estimated VNB margins expansion of 20bps quarter-on-quarter based on expected business mix changes.Shares of LIC had a stellar run in the recent past, scaling lifetime peak of Rs 1,050 following 71% spike in the last 3 months. LIC, which was struggling to cross its IPO price of Rs 949 in 2022, have now breached the Rs 1,000-mark.In December, the finance ministry had granted time to the PSU insurer for complying with 25% minimum public shareholding till 2032. The stock has been rallying since then as the exemption reduces the possibility of an offer for sale (OFS) by the government.In May 2022, the government had sold 3.5% stake in LIC IPO which was an entirely (offer for sale) worth around Rs 21,000 crore. It remains India's largest IPO till date.Analysts expect the positive upside to continue on expectations of growth revival in FY25, and the possibility of a step change in dividend will continue to support its share price performance.\"With the worst, in terms of structural issues of growth differential and sticky cost, now likely to be behind, LIC shares have entered the outperformance mode since H1FY24 results, led by favorable valuation, strong EV growth on account of buoyant equity markets, hope of growth revival in FY25 owing to a favorable base and widening of product offering, and likely hope of a step jump in dividend,\" Emkay Global had said.(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

            "text": "Amid the ongoing rally in Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) stock, the market capitalisation (m-cap) of the state-owned insurance behemoth surged nearly Rs 1.8 lakh crore in the past two months. M-cap of the public sector insurer jumped to around Rs 5.65 lakh crore on January 16, 2024 as against Rs 3.86 lakh crore on November 16, 2023. Shares of LIC jumped 46 per cent to Rs 892.50 during the same period. Meanwhile, the scrip scaled a 52-week high of Rs 900 on January 16.\n\nOf late, life insurers collected 43.76 per cent higher year-on-year new business premium (NBP) in December 2023 on the back of LIC\u2019s strong performance, which saw 93.79 per cent growth in NBP. However, the market share of LIC stood at 58.9 per cent as of December 31, 2023, as against 65.4 per cent a year ago.\n\nAccording to KR Choksey Shares and Securities, LIC has been focusing on product mix improvements, with a stronger focus on the non-par segment and that LIC will capitalise on the industry\u2019s growth opportunities, aided by its significant AUM and geographical expansion.\n\nEarlier, shares of LIC witnessed heavy selling pressure after listing on bourses in May 2022. After listing at Rs 867.20, the scrip scaled an all-time low of Rs 530.2 on March 29, 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, the market capitalisation of the country\u2019s largest lender by assets State Bank of India (SBI) increased by Rs 46,765 crore to Rs 5.68 lakh crore on January 16, 2024 from Rs 5.22 lakh crore on November 16, 2023. This shows that the gap between the m-cap of LIC and SBI narrowed down to Rs 3,813 crore on January 16, 2024 as against Rs 1.36 lakh crore on November 16, 2023.",

The KSE-30 index increased by 10.75 points or 0.05 percent to 21,731.67 points against 21,720.93 points.\n\nAnalyst Ahsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corp said the positive close was spurred by the IMF deal, a $128 million current account surplus in February, and RDA deposits exceeding $7.4 billion, bolstering the rupee.\n\n\"The rally in dollar bonds to a year\u2019s peak following the IMF\u2019s preliminary approval for a $1.1 billion payout also played a key role.\"\n\nTraded shares increased by 18 million shares to 341.843 million shares from 323.281 million shares. The trading value dropped to Rs11.844 billion from Rs17.059 billion. Market capitalization expanded to Rs9.288 trillion from Rs9.262 trillion. Of the 342 companies active in the session, 173 closed in the green, 146 in the red, and 23 remained unchanged.\n\nSeveral sectors, including exploration & production (E&P), automotive, banking, and technology, contributed negatively to the index performance, with companies such as MARI, PPL, MTL, PSO, TRG, and HBL collectively shedding 266 points.\n\nThe fertilizer and banking sectors contributed positively to the index as FFC, MEBL, NBP, PKGS, and ENGRO added 151 points.\n\nThe highest increase was recorded in Nestl\u00e9 Pakistan Limited shares, which rose by Rs90 to Rs7,510 per share, followed by Philip Morris (Pakistan) Limited, which increased by Rs39.89 to Rs749.99 per share. A significant decline was noted in Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited, which fell by Rs424.49 to Rs8,575.01 per share, followed by Siemens (Pakistan) Engineering, which closed lower by Rs14.43 to Rs582.01 per share.\n\nBrokerage Arif Habib Ltd said, following another attempt to breach the 66,000 points level, the benchmark index faced a setback, \"yet investors remain optimistic as this resistance could potentially lead to a stronger breakthrough in the future.\"\n\nNotable performers included PIAA and PTC, while DAWH, FFC, and NBP were the primary contributors to index gains.\n\n\"Despite the recent rejection at 66,000 points, the outlook for the KSE-100 remains positive, with investors closely monitoring developments as they anticipate a potential breakthrough past this critical resistance level.\"\n\nThe Bank of Punjab XD remained the volume leader with 45.010 million shares, which closed higher by 14 paisas to Rs5.28 per share. WorldCall Telecom followed it with 34.431 million shares, which closed lower by 2 paisas to Rs1.36 per share.\n\nOther significant turnover stocks included The Organic Meat, K-Electric Ltd., Kohinoor Spinning, Telecard Limited, Hascol Petrol, Unity Foods Ltd, National Bank XD, and Cnergyico PK.\n\nIn the Future Market, 313 companies recorded trading, of which 148 increased, 160 decreased, and 5 remained unchanged.",

            "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShares of Life Insurance Corporation ( LIC ) jumped 10% today to record best single-day gain since listing. Investors appear to be buoyed by the company's plans to launch 3-4 new products over the coming months to push growth in its new business premium (NBP).Trading at 20 times its 20-day average trading volume, LIC shares hit two-month high at Rs 680 and surpassed above its 50 and 100-DMA levels.A similar buying interest was also seen in two other PSU insurance stocks. While General Insurance Corporation of India shares jumped 18%, the counter of The New India Assurance Company was locked in 20% upper circuit limit.LIC Chairman Siddhartha Mohanty had told PTI in an interview that the state-run insurer was projecting a double-digit growth in the current financial year over the last year. LIC intends to achieve this goal by launching some new attractive products, Mohanty revealed.LIC is going to launch one product in the first week of December, he said, hoping that it will attract a lot of traction in the market. In addition, he said, loan facility and premature withdrawal would also be a feature of the new product.Guaranteed return products are in the interest of policyholders and shareholders, he said, adding that many shareholders are also policyholders. \"So, it is a dual benefit for policyholders,\" he had said.The stock has been a market laggard and returned just approximately 3% returns in the last 12 months as against 8% returns given by the Nifty. In 2023, its performance has been even worse with over 9% price erosion over the previous year.Since its listing on May 17, 2022, the stock has been on a downhill and fell to a low of Rs 530.05 on March 23, 2023. Though it has made an upward move, it is still trading at a 44% discount from its issue price of Rs 949.LIC's Q2 earnings have also failed to inspire any confidence among the investors. India's largest life insurer reported a 50% decline in net profit to Rs 7,925 crore for the quarter ending September 30, 2023.During the same period last year, LIC had reported a net profit of Rs 15,952 crore. However, LIC clarified that these profits are not directly comparable due to accounting changes.LIC changed its accounting policy in September 2022 regarding the transfer of the amount (net of tax) related to the accretion on the available solvency margin from the non-participating policyholder's account to the shareholder's account.During FY23, Rs 27,241 crore (net of tax) was transferred, including Rs 14,272 crore (net of tax) in the quarter ended September 2022.In the first-half of FY23, the actual profit increased by 44.45% to Rs 17,469 crore from Rs 12,093 crores. This half-year profit incorporates an amount of Rs 13,768 crore (net of tax), related to the accretions on the available solvency margin, transferred from the non-par fund to the shareholders' account. The Solvency Ratio, as of September 30, 2023, improved to 1.90 compared to 1.88.The value of new business (VNB) for the six-month period ending September 30, 2023 fell 10% to Rs 3,304 crore, compared to Rs 3,677 crore in the corresponding period last year, while the net VNB margin for this period remained constant at 14.6%.",

            "text": "Shares of Life Insurance Corporation of India surged nearly 10% on Friday (November 24) \u2014 the most since its listing on a closing basis, amid expectations of double-digit growth in new business premiums. New business premium (NBP) is the premium, which is due on policy in the first year of a life insurance contract or a single lump sum payment from the policyholder.\n\nWith Friday\u2019s gain, the stock of LIC has rallied as much as 27% over the last eight months. Yet, the stock is trading some 30% below to its IPO price. The trading volume on the counters went up to nearly two crores, which is 18 times the three-month average of about 10 lakh shares. In fact, the combined volume on BSE and NSE surged to the second biggest ever.\n\nThe rally in shares also saw LIC\u2019s market capitalisation swell by \u20b9 38,000 crore on Friday, which stands at \u20b9 4.3 lakh crore.\n\nIn an interaction with news agency PTI, Chairman Siddhartha Mohanty sounded quite optimistic on achieving double digit growth in new business premiums in FY24. Mohanty observed that higher growth based on recent trends showed an \u201cuptick in individual retail business.\u201d In order to further reinforce our commitment, we are going to launch some new attractive products, added Mohanty.\n\nHowever, in the first half of the current financial year, LIC clocked 2.7% growth in new business premium, which increased to \u20b9 25,184 crore from \u20b9 24,535 crore reported in the same period last year. For FY23, the growth in the new business premium segment was 6.9%. LIC\u2019s moat is its strong agency network (1.35mn) which commands 49% market share and contributed 96% of the company\u2019s individual NBP at end-H1FY24.",
