            "text": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) lost more than 300 points on Monday, traders said, with stock analysts attributing the slump to political uncertainty ahead of the national elections in February.\n\nThe benchmark KSE-100 index lost 368 points to close at 64,269 points at the end of the session on Monday, according to the PSX website.\n\nThe bears returned to the trading floor days after resolutions were tabled in the upper house of parliament, the Senate, calling for a delay of national elections, due to be held on Feb. 8.\n\n\u201cStocks closed bearish amid pre-poll uncertainty and concerns over outcome of ongoing Senate resolutions to postpone general elections due next month,\u201d Ahsan Mehanti, chief executive officer of the Karachi-based capital market company Arif Habib Corporation, told Arab News.\n\nThe development also came two days after the Supreme Court of Pakistan denied poll symbol to former prime minister Imran Khan\u2019s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party, which is one of the three major political parties in Pakistan, diminishing its chances of making a significant mark in the elections.\n\nThe ruling upset hundreds of thousands of supporters of Khan, who is widely seen as the country\u2019s most popular leader and remains behind bars since August in a graft case.\n\nMehanti believed the recent \u201cpolitical noise,\u201d coupled with uncertainty about the central bank monetary policy announcement, resulted in Monday\u2019s bearish close of the market.\n\n\u201cPolitical noise, geo-political uncertainty and uncertainty over SBP (State Bank of Pakistan) policy announcement this month amid high inflation played a catalyst role in the bearish close,\u201d he said.\n\nElections in the politically and economically troubled South Asian nation were originally due to be held in November, 90 days after the dissolution of the lower house of parliament in August, but they were delayed to February due to fresh demarcation of constituencies under a new census.\n\nHowever, Pakistan\u2019s election regulator has categorically ruled out delaying the elections.\n\n\u201cECP (Election Commission of Pakistan) has made all necessary arrangements regarding the conduct of General Elections 2024,\u201d the ECP said in a recent letter addressed to the Senate Secretariat.",

Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "The National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) branch building can be seen. \u2014 NBP website\n\nKARACHI: National Bank of Pakistan (NBP), one of the country's largest lenders, on Thursday posted a 72 percent surge in annual profit after tax, driven by a sharp rise in interest income.\n\nNBP reported a profit after tax of Rs53.32 billion for the calendar year 2023, up from RS30.95 billion in the previous year, according to a notice sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange. Earnings per share rose to Rs24.96 from Rs14.49, the bank said, adding that its board did not recommend any cash dividend.\n\nThe bank attributed the strong performance to a nearly 104 percent increase in mark-up/return earned, which reached Rss1,025.13 billion in 2023, compared to Rs503.58 billion in 2022.\n\nThe net mark-up/return earned jumped 45 percent to Rs169.36 billion, while its fee and commission income rose 7 percent to Rs24.14 billion.\n\nThe foreign exchange income, however declined 7 percent to Rs7.7 billion , and its operating expenses increased 20 percent to Rs95.45 billion.\n\nThe NBP also recorded a 294 percent gain on securities of Rs4.42 billion, and a Rs227 percent increase in share of profit from joint venture and association of Rs1.47 billion.\n\nThe profit before tax stood at Rs103.3 billion, up 62 percent from the previous year. Maintaining its leading market position, the bank achieved Rs6.5 trillion milestone in its balance sheet that grew 27 percent to reach Rs6,652.7 billion from Rs5,240.4 billion at the end of 2022,\" NBP said in a statement. \"This makes NBP the largest bank in Pakistan in terms of total assets.\"\n\nThe statement said bank's board \"deliberated at length whether or not cash dividend should be recommended\". \"However, the likely impact of the pension case and other contingencies, still remains a cause of concern for the board. Accordingly, the board considered it prudent to retain the profits for the time being and once the position becomes clearer, the bank may consider declaration of dividend at a later stage.\"\n\nIMC posts 88.6 percent profit rise despite sales slump\n\nIndus Motor Company Limited (IMC), the maker of Toyota cars in Pakistan, reported an 88.6 percent jump in profit after tax for the six months ended December 31, 2023, despite a sharp drop in sales and production due to weak demand and supply chain disruptions.\n\nThe company posted a profit after tax of Rs4.96 billion #, up from Rs2.63 billion in the same period a year earlier, according to a statement issued on Thursday.\n\nThe net sales turnover decreased by 41.4 percent to Rs50.91 billion, as compared to Rs86.83 billion for the same period last year. The company's overall market share for the quarter stood at 18 percent.\n\nThe earnings per share of the company for the half year ended December 31, 2023, was Rs63.07, in comparison to of Rs33.43 in the same period last year.\n\nThe board of directors declared a second interim cash dividend of Rs13.20 per share. This is in addition to the first interim cash dividend of Rs24.5 per share already paid.\n\nThe combined sales of CKD and CBU vehicles decreased by 61 percent to 7,324 units compared to 18,672 units sold in the previous year. Vehicle production too decreased by 66 percent to 6,391 units as compared to 18,562 units produced in the same period last year.\n\nThe decline in production was mainly due to weak consumer demand and vendor supply chain limitations, which led to regular plant shutdowns during the period, the company said.\n\n\"The country's economy continues to grapple with high fiscal deficit, sky rocketing inflation and power tariff hikes. Customer traffic at dealerships remained lackluster, owing to several factors, such as higher duties and taxes, high interest rates, low auto financing availability and relatively dampened consumer purchasing power,\" IMC Chief Executive, Ali Asghar Jamali, said in the statement.\n\nHe added that supply chain challenges continued to adversely affect the auto sector, as a consequence of which, it operated at below 30 percent production capacity, the lowest in the last decade, leading to forced frequent plant shutdowns.\n\nJamali also said that the company faced challenges in maintaining a level playing field within the automotive sector due to consistent rise in duties and taxes for locally manufactured vehicles while on the other hand, the government relaxed the import and taxation regime for used cars, thereby emphasizing the need for fair competition.\n\n\"Despite all the challenges, I am hopeful that with the new government in place, the country and the overall business environment shall well be on its path to stability, In Sha Allah,\" he said.\n\nSPL posts 122 percent jump in half-year profit\n\nSecurity Papers Limited (SPL) reported a 122 percent surge in its net profit for the first half of the financial year ending December 31, 2023, boosted by higher sales and improved margins.\n\nThe company said its profit after tax rose to Rs746 million, or Rs12.59 per share, in the six months ended June 30, 2023, from Rs336 million, or Rs5.67 per share, in the same period last year. Its revenue increased by 38 percent to Rs3.49 billion from Rs2.53 billion a year earlier.\n\nThe company's gross profit margin improved to 28 percent from 19 percent in the same period last year, as its cost of sales grew by 26 percent to Rs2.51 billion from Rs1.99 billio.\n\nSPL chairman Mohammad Aftab Manzoor attributed the strong performance to the company's strategic focus on operational efficiency and cost reduction, as well as the positive impact of several reforms introduced in the company.\n\n\u201cOur strategic vision and relentless focus on new initiatives and diversification has more than doubled the EPS of the company. The SPL\u2019s strong performance is a testament to its commitment to progress aimed at delivering value to shareholders and customers,\u201d he said in a statement.\n\nManzoor also expressed confidence in the future prospects of the company, citing a recently signed technical consultancy agreement with a leading European security paper company that will help SPL benchmark its operational efficiencies and prepare comprehensive efficiency and cost improvement plans. The company also announced an interim cash dividend of Rs2.5 per share.",

            "text": "The stock market serves as a barometer of a nation\u2019s economic health, responding to various factors such as economic indicators, political stability, and overall market sentiment. In the case of Pakistan, recent developments have painted an optimistic picture for its stock market. After a prolonged period of volatility and uncertainty, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has witnessed a remarkable turnaround. It\u2019s vital to explore the positive indicators that have fueled this resurgence, focusing on political stability and the recent staff-level agreement between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nOne of the key drivers behind the resurgence of the Pakistani stock market has been the restoration of political stability in the country. Political uncertainty can have a detrimental impact on the stock market, as investors tend to be cautious in such an environment. However, a significant milestone was achieved on November 3 when an agreement was reached between the President and the Chief Election Commissioner regarding the date of the general elections. This agreement cleared the political fog that had been looming over the nation for some time. For over six and a half years, the Pakistan Stock Exchange had struggled to cross the psychological threshold of 53,000 points. The prolonged political instability and uncertainty had kept investors on edge, leading to subdued market performance. However, with the resolution of political disputes, investors regained confidence in the market, resulting in a sustained upward trajectory.\n\nSince crossing the 53,000-point mark, the Pakistani stock market has been on a steady upward trend. The positive sentiment among investors has been reflected in the market\u2019s performance, with consecutive weeks of gains. Most notably, the benchmark index recently surged past the 57,000-point mark, reaching its highest level in years. This remarkable growth has not only instilled confidence in local investors but has also attracted foreign investors looking for opportunities in Pakistan\u2019s burgeoning economy.\n\nAnother significant factor contributing to the bullish sentiment in the Pakistani stock market is the recent staff-level agreement between Pakistan and the International Monetary Fund. This agreement signifies the country\u2019s commitment to implementing economic reforms and addressing fiscal challenges. The IMF\u2019s support and approval of Pakistan\u2019s reform agenda have reassured investors, both domestic and foreign, of the government\u2019s dedication to achieving economic stability. Under the IMF agreement, Pakistan has committed to a series of structural reforms, including fiscal consolidation, revenue mobilization, and improvements in the business environment. These reforms are expected to create a more favorable economic environment, attracting investment and promoting sustainable growth. Investors have responded positively to this commitment, leading to increased confidence in the Pakistani market\u2019s potential.\n\nApart from political stability and the IMF agreement, several economic indicators are contributing to the positive outlook for Pakistan\u2019s stock market. These indicators highlight the country\u2019s economic resilience and growth potential. Pakistan has witnessed gradual but consistent GDP growth in recent years. This growth is indicative of a strengthening economy and a growing consumer base, which can translate into higher corporate earnings and stock market performance. Pakistan\u2019s foreign exchange reserves have improved, providing a cushion against external shocks and bolstering investor confidence. A robust reserve position is essential for maintaining stability in the foreign exchange market. The ongoing development of the CPEC has opened up new avenues for investment and economic growth in Pakistan. This mega-project has the potential to transform the country\u2019s infrastructure and boost economic activity, positively impacting the stock market. The State Bank of Pakistan has pursued a relatively accommodative monetary policy, with lower interest rates. This policy has encouraged borrowing and investment, further stimulating economic growth and corporate profitability. The government\u2019s efforts to control inflation have been relatively successful, leading to greater purchasing power for consumers and a more stable economic environment.\n\nThe surge in the Pakistani stock market has been underpinned by strong buying activity across various sectors. Notably, the energy sector has witnessed significant interest, with companies in this sector experiencing substantial share price gains. This interest in energy can be attributed to expectations of increased energy demand as the economy expands, alongside potential government initiatives to enhance energy infrastructure. The automobile sector has also been a driving force behind the stock market\u2019s upswing. Demand for automobiles in Pakistan has been steadily growing, and investors are keen to capitalize on this trend. Banking, cement, and fertilizers are additional sectors that have contributed to the market\u2019s gains. The stability and growth potential of these sectors have drawn the attention of both local and foreign investors, further boosting market performance.\n\nThe Key Market Statistics index, reflecting the overall performance of the Pakistani stock market, recently gained an impressive 294 points. What\u2019s particularly notable is that nearly 60% of companies\u2019 share prices saw an increase, indicating a broad-based rally across various industries. This diverse participation suggests that the market\u2019s resurgence is not limited to a few select sectors but rather encompasses a more comprehensive and sustainable growth pattern. The total investment value surged by a substantial 27 billion 30 crore 62 lakhs, underscoring the increasing confidence of investors in the market\u2019s potential. Business volume also experienced a substantial uptick, rising by an impressive 40.92%. These statistics demonstrate the renewed enthusiasm among market participants. While the market turnover reached one billion shares, the 100-index remained at its three-day high. This stability in the 100-index, despite the increased turnover, indicates that the market\u2019s rally is not merely driven by speculative trading but rather by genuine optimism about the nation\u2019s economic prospects.\n\nPerhaps one of the most significant milestones in the recent surge of the Pakistani stock market is the attainment of the highest market capitalization level since August 2021, now standing at 8 thousand 322 billion rupees. Market capitalization is a crucial metric that reflects the overall value of publicly traded companies and, by extension, the confidence investors have in the economy.\n\nThe Pakistani stock market\u2019s resurgence, marked by its crossing the 57,000-point threshold, is a testament to the positive indicators that are shaping the country\u2019s economic landscape. Political stability, highlighted by the agreement between the President and the Chief Election Commissioner, has removed a major hurdle for investors. Furthermore, the staff-level agreement with the IMF and a host of favorable economic indicators have generated confidence in the market\u2019s potential for growth. Investors, both domestic and foreign, are increasingly viewing Pakistan as an attractive destination for investment. The commitment to economic reforms and the ongoing development of projects like the CPEC provide ample opportunities for businesses to thrive. As the Pakistani government continues to work towards economic stability and growth, the stock market is likely to remain a bright spot, reflecting the nation\u2019s positive trajectory. However, it\u2019s essential to keep in mind that the stock market is inherently volatile, and investors should exercise caution and conduct thorough research before making investment decisions.",

            "text": "KARACHI: After a robust overnight rally, the stock market came under renewed profit-selling by nervous investors amid growing economic uncertainty as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index settled below the 65,000 level on Friday.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said challenges over external financing, uncertainty about the outcome of the ongoing IMF review and status quo expectations in the monetary policy announcement on March 18 amid SPI inflation surging 32.89pc year-on-year played a catalyst role in the bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd attributed the market volatility to news reports that the IMF mission has expressed displeasure over the Ministry of Finance\u2019s verdict that it had materialised all structural benchmarks before the completion of the review by the visiting mission.\n\nThe major positive contribution came from Engro Fertilisers, Meezan Bank Ltd, Lucky Cement, National Bank of Pakistan, Mari Petroleum Ltd and Systems Ltd, which cumulatively added 135 points to the index. On the other hand, Oil and Gas Development Company, Hub Power, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, Bank Al-Habib, United Bank Ltd and PSO wiped out 179 points.\n\nThe index traded between its intraday high of 289 points and low of 248 points. As a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,816.47 points after losing 247.80 points or 0.38 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading dipped 17.72pc to 259.37 million shares.

            "text": "\u2022 Warns sale of SOEs to foreign states under G2G contracts may lead to litigation\n\n\u2022 Claims PTI govt\u2019s Sarmaya-i-Pakistan model delayed reforms\n\nISLAMABAD: The World Bank has raised concerns over Pakistan\u2019s approach to privatising its state-owned entities (SOEs) and highlighted the adverse impacts of judicial activism, political nuisance, sale of K-Electric and what it called the botched Sarmaya-i-Pakistan model.\n\nThe financial institution cautioned the government of looming litigation in divestments to foreign states under government-to-government contracts and instead advised public offerings through stock exchanges followed by privatisation under the transparent oversight of a special joint committee of the parliament.\n\nIn its Public Expenditure Review 2023, the bank specifically addressed the Inter-Governmental Commercial Transactions Act 2022, which allows the government to offer SOE shares to foreign governments. Such a move, the bank warned, could lead to litigation, raise questions about transparency and full disclosure and may slow down the privatisation process further.\n\nThe bank pointed out that the profitability of SOEs in Pakistan had been declining and turning into losses for about a decade. Things have come to a stage that now \u201cthe profitability of Pakistan\u2019s federal SOEs is the lowest in the South Asian Region\u201d as their aggregate profit at 0.8pc of GDP in 2014 turned into losses worth 0.4pc of GDP in 2020 and growing, thus becoming a major driver of fiscal deficit and source of substantial fiscal risk.\n\nThe World Bank identified \u201ckey factors leading to unsuccessful privatisation efforts as economic volatility, judicial activism, litigation, weak political commitment and perceptions of corruption cost post-2007\u201d.\n\nIt said that the ideologue in some of the mainstream political parties opposed privatisation regardless of the performance of individual SOEs and preferred offering 12pc SOE shares to employees through the Benazir Employees Stock Option Scheme (Besos), and the general perception of privatisation remained highly contentious triggering negative sentiment because of elite capture, resultant unemployment and social unrest.\n\nAlso, \u201cjudicial decisions in the Pakistan Steel Mills privatisation and Reko Diq mining contract cases badly hurt Pakistan\u2019s image as an untrustworthy country where international contracts are not honoured, and business always run the risk of falling victim\u201d, the bank said.\n\nAlso, Pakistan\u2019s failure in international arbitrations in critical cases deterred key decision-makers of the government from further privatisation or seeking foreign direct investment on top of generous international treaties involving neo-liberal investment forums without consideration of the state\u2019s exposure.\n\nOn top of that, the incorporation of Sarmaya-i-Pakistan Limited (SPL) by the PTI government in 2019 with the mandate to take management control of all SOEs and revamp or privatise them further delayed the process, but the SPL actually never took off.\n\nWith particular reference to the power sector, the World Bank said privatisation could not take off because of resistance from trade unions and vested interests, fear of private sector monopoly and previous experience of privatising a distribution company, circular debt and management issues.\n\nIt said the \u201cunsatisfactory performance [of K-Electric] even after privatisation, despite tariff hikes, because of weak financial management, governance structure, operational and commercial inefficiencies, and unscheduled load-shedding resulted in public demonstrations against K-Electric\u201d and raised serious questions about the benefits of further privatisation of other distribution companies (Discos).\n\nThe bank advised that in order to get rid of continuous bleeding and proceed with the privatisation successfully, Pakis\u00adtan should take necessary measures for political and macroeconomic stability, signal a strong political commitment to the privatisation agenda and build a broad-based coalition of change underlining structural challenges in the economy and the need for privatisation.\n\nSimultaneously, the privatisation commission should be revamped \u201cwith able professionals who can prepare a financial model for each entity to be privatised\u201d and ensure that privatisation would promote efficiency and competition in the relevant sub-sector of the economy rather than leading to private-sector monopolies and cartelisation that would require strengthening the regulatory bodies to protect the general public.\n\nIn this direction, the Competition Commission of Pakistan will need to be equipped with powers so that an appeal against its decisions will only be entertained by the courts after depositing the penalty amount.\n\nAlso, the government should ensure necessary safeguards to make the entire privatisation process more transparent to avoid a repeat of the observations made by the Supreme Court of Pakistan, besides further strengthening parliamentary oversight of privatisation by forming a Special Joint Committee of the Parliament reviewing the process.\n\nIn doing so, the government should guarantee the necessary safeguards to mitigate the social impact and costs of privatisation \u2014 such as displacement of workers adding to the already high unemployment rate \u2014 as done in cases of successful privatisation.\n\nThe World Bank advised Pakistan to \u201cmake public offering of SOEs shares\u201d, which is the easiest way to gradually move towards divestment and ultimately privatisation or awarding management concessionaire, a model that worked successfully in the banking and telecommunication sector.\n\nThe government has also been asked to restructure Discos, especially those making losses, in terms of financial health and rationalising human resources and to award a management concessionaire to the private sector while ensuring that it did not lead to the concentration of assets in few hands, thus creating private sector monopolies.\n\nIt advised gradual divestment of government shares by the public offering of shares of Discos while safeguarding procedural and process transparency and finally, phasing out government shares.\n\nBut this will require an effective regulatory framework to promote efficiency, investment to improve service delivery and competition.\n\nPublished in Dawn, October 9th, 2023",
