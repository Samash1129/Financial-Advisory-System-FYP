            "text": "The Bank of Punjab (BOP) has decided to join the ranks of other prominent banks in the country by establishing its wholly-owned exchange company with an authorized capital of Rs2.50 billion.\n\nIn a stock filing at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday, the Bank of Punjab said that its board, in their meeting held on October 28, 2023, has approved the establishment of an exchange company in the view of current market potential, future expansion, and recently introduced structural reforms by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) in the exchange companies sector.\n\nHowever, establishing the exchange company is contingent upon approval from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and full compliance with pertinent laws and regulations.\n\nRead This: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nBOP\u2019s initiative is a crucial component of a wider campaign by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) aimed at curbing illicit activities within the underground market. The SBP has recently introduced structural reforms within the exchange company sector to enhance regulatory oversight, bolster governance frameworks, fortify internal controls, and tighten compliance protocols.\n\nFurthermore, the SBP has raised the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional stipulation that the capital must be unencumbered by prior losses.\n\nEarlier, major banks including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), Bank Alfalah (BAFL), Habib Metropolitan Bank and Askari Bank Limited announced to established their own forex companies.\n\nThe SBP has recently issued no-objection certificate (NOC) to ABL and MCB for establishing their exchange companies. Allied Bank\u2019s exchange company will be named ABL Exchange Company (Private) Limited and MCB\u2019s as MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

            "text": "After a week of uncertainty, bearish sentiment returned to the trading floor of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Monday as shares opened the week in the red.\n\nAccording to the PSX website, the KSE-100 index declined by 925.35 points to close at 65,204.67 points, down 1.4 per cent from the previous close of 66,130.02.\n\nTop active stocks included Worldcall Telecom Limited, K-Electric Limited, Cnergyico PK Limited, Hascol Petroleum Limited and The Bank of Punjab.\n\nThe stock market observed a roller coaster ride last week, closing at 66,130 points after declining by 94 points or 0.14pc from a week ago.\n\nAccording to analysts, anxiety over the strained rupee position amid rising demand and poor inflows of dollars has increased. The dwindling inflows are set against the backdrop of import expenditures that are twice as high as exports.\n\nAmreen Soorani, head of research at JS Global, noted that the index had rallied by more than 60pc this year. \u201cTherefore, investors are bound to book profits at some point as witnessed since the past trade sessions,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cA correction after a sharp rise can be healthy for the market. The index is still undervalued and has upside on the cards, in addition to attractive dividend yield picks,\u201d she added.\n\nRaza Jafri, head of equities at Intermarket Securities, told Dawn.com that Pakistan was entering a \u201ccritical phase\u201d in the next few months where it would have to navigate elections and enter the successor International Monetary Fund programme in a \u201ctimely manner\u201d.\n\n\u201cWe remain positive across 2024, but there can be nervous days in the near term, especially given the market\u2019s quick run-up in the last few months,\u201d he said.",

Yesterday, it had closed at 51,027.94 points. By close, however, the index settled 149.19 points, or 0.29pc ahead.\n\nOn Monday, the stocks rallied in anticipation of a substantial hike in gas prices by the Economic Coordination Committee. The energy sector was the main player in this surge.\n\nHowever, the index experienced minor losses on Tuesday as investors decided to off-load. The drivers behind the decline were cited to be geopolitical uncertainties and anxiety over the IMF review in November for the $710 million tranche release.\n\nMajor activity was reported in stocks such as Worldcall Telecom Limited, The Bank of Punjab, Fauji Cement Company Limited, Pakistan State Oil Company Limited and Oil & Gas Development Company Limited.\n\nTop advancers included Tri-Star Mutual Fund Limited, Al Shaheer Corporation Limited, Next Capital Limited, Shabbir Tiles & Ceramics Limited and First Punjab Modaraba.\n\nTop decliners included Dewan Sugar Mills Limited, Reliance Weaving Mills Limited, Rupali Polyester Limited, Pakistan Paper Products Limited and Pakistan Hotels Developers Limited.",

            "text": "KARACHI: The benchmark of major shares galloped higher on Tuesday, crossing the psychological barrier of 60,000 points for the first time in history.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Topline Securities Ltd CEO Mohammed Sohail said the rally in stock prices witnessed since the beginning of 2023-24 has been one of the fastest in the last two decades.\n\nOne of the key reasons for the steep rise in share prices is unusual foreign buying. Dollar inflows, especially from overseas corporate investors, have helped sustain the rally that has tossed the index up by more than 38 per cent in the last five months alone.\n\nFor perspective, net foreign investment in the stock market since the beginning of July has been $36 million versus only $2.5m recorded in the preceding January-June period.\n\nOf all PSX-listed shares worth roughly $30 billion, holdings by foreign investors currently account for $1.3bn or 4.3pc. \u201cDespite incessant foreign buying in recent months, their holdings in the PSX are still nowhere close to the level of 2017,\u201d he said.\n\nThe value of all PSX-listed shares in 2017 hovered around $100bn when foreign investors controlled a share of roughly 10pc or $10bn at the time.\n\n\u201cValuations also continue to be low because corporate earnings have risen at such a fast pace,\u201d he said while referring to the rather depressed price-to-earnings multiple \u2014 a ratio that measures a company\u2019s share value relative to its per-share income.\n\nThe constituent stocks of the KSE-100 index are still trading at a multiple of four times their collective earnings, a level that\u2019s half the 10-year average of eight.\n\n\u201cI expect the KSE-100 index to hit 75,000 points by December 2024,\u201d said Mr Sohail.\n\nOne key threat to this forecast is Islamabad returning to fiscal mismanagement after the conclusion of the ongoing International Monetary Fund loan programme early next year. Failure to execute a peaceful transfer of power in the coming months constitutes another big threat to the stock market rally, he added.\n\nThe KSE-100 index closed at 60,730.26 points after gaining 918.92 points or 1.54pc from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume increased 18.5pc to 779.6m shares. The traded value increased 28.9pc to Rs26.1bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Kohinoor Spinning Mills Ltd (79.2m shares), WorldCall Telecom Ltd (57.4m shares), the Bank of Punjab Ltd (44.3m shares), Cnergyico PK Ltd (31.3m shares) and Treet Corp\u00adoration Ltd (27.2m shares).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Hoechst Pakistan Ltd (Rs85), Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs80.28), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs66.37), Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs50) and Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs48.17).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs100), Rafhan Maize Products Company Ltd (Rs57.05), Mari Petroleum Company Ltd (Rs37.19), Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (Rs15.50) and Pakistan Hotels Developers Ltd (Rs15.47).\n\nForeign investors were net buyers as they purchased shares worth $5.08m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 29th, 2023",

            "text": "KARACHI: In a move to attract small investors who shy away from stock investing partly because of excessive documentation, the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) has \u201cfurther simplified\u201d the brokerage account-opening procedure.\n\nIn a brief note on Thursday, the national bourse said it has made a \u201csignificant reduction\u201d in the number of data fields required for customer on-boarding.\n\nAs a result, the updated Sahulat KYC (know-your-client) and account-opening forms now require only identity details, address, income level, profession, source of income and bank account information.\n\nLaunched in April 2022, the Sahulat Account lets small retail investors buy and sell shares on the PSX by opening a basic account with a brokerage house after submitting their computerised/smart national identity cards.\n\nAll licensed securities brokers are now offering Sahulat Accounts, which can be opened online as well.\n\nUnlike traditional brokerage accounts, investors don\u2019t have to submit any specific evidence for their source of income for opening Sahulat Acco\u00adunts. In other words, brokers won\u2019t require salary slips or bank statements from potential stock market investors if they choose to open this kind of brokerage accounts.\n\nAny individual identified as \u201clow risk\u201d through risk assessment can open a Sahulat Account. The securities broker may apply simplified due-diligence measures, which include the verification of the identity of customers.\n\nDespite being as old as the country itself, the stock exchange has an extremely low investor base. The number of individual accounts was only 290,316 at the end of July 2023. The number of accounts held by institutional investors and \u201cfunds/others\u201d totalled 1,803 and 1,285, respectively.\n\nFor context, the number of crypto wallets \u2014 which hold the keys to investors\u2019 digital coins stored on public blockchain networks \u2014 in Pakistan hovers around 10 million despite a big question mark on their legal status.\n\nThe low number of retail investors means companies as well as the government face difficulty in mobilising public funds in a cost-efficient manner.\n\nThe general public tends to park their money with banks, which lend mainly to the government that, in turn, uses those funds to finance its budget deficit at a high interest rate.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 3rd, 2023",

            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed some productivity on Tuesday, although it failed to build on Monday\u2019s gains as investors continued grappling with uncertainty over the political scenario.\n\nThe trading session began positively, reaching an intraday high of 61,237.51 points before midday. However, the KSE-100 index couldn\u2019t sustain this momentum as investors struggled with warnings from Fitch regarding potential upheavals on the International Monetary Fund (IMF) programme and dismal data on the current account deficit, which stood at $269 million in January 2024. Consequently, the index slipped below the 61,000 mark and eventually touched an intraday low of 60,420.83 points in its final trading hours.\n\nDespite this, Barclays remained optimistic, stating that Pakistan is unlikely to default on Eurobonds and praised the Sharif-led government for playing a less disruptive role. This aided the index to close on a positive note with some gains.\n\nNotably, in the pharmaceutical sector, stocks surged following news of deregulation on non-essential medication prices. \u201cStocks closed flat as investors weigh Fitch warnings over upheavals on IMF programme on political uncertainty and dismal data on the current account deficit at $269 million in January 2024,\u201d said Arif Habib Corp MD Ahsan Mehanti.\n\n\u201cBarclays overweight on Pakistan unlikely to opt default on Eurobonds and asserts Sharif-led government less disruptive played catalyst role in positive close.\u201d\n\nAt the close, the benchmark KSE-100 index recorded gains of 4.50 points, or 0.01%, settling at 60,464.24.\n\nTopline Securities noted in its report that the KSE-100 index opened positively, reaching an intraday high of 777.77 points. However, the index couldn\u2019t sustain the positivity, closing at 60,464.24 (+4.50 points).\n\n\u201cThe market sentiment soured amidst enduring political gridlock hampering the formation of the federal government and a dearth of favourable catalysts.\u201d\n\n\n\nRead PSX rebounds on political stability optimism\n\n\u201cIn the pharmaceutical domain, a surge ensued following news of the ministry\u2019s green light for deregulating the prices of non-essential medications,\u201d it said. Arif Habib Limited (AHL) observed in its report that the inability to build on Monday\u2019s gains saw the KSE-100 contained with HoD coming in at 61,237, well below 62,000 near term resistance.\n\n\u201c49 stocks rose and 42 fell with Hub Power Company (+1.99%), Systems Limited (+2.28%), and Pakistan State Oil (+3.65%) the biggest contributors to index gains while Oil and Gas Development Company (-2.18%), Pakistan Petroleum (-2.06%), and Mari Petroleum Company (-2.03%) the largest downside contributors,\u201d AHL added.\n\nJS Global analyst Mohammed Waqar Iqbal noted that the positive news flow on the political front regarding a resolution to form a government lifted the market. \u201cGoing forward, we recommend investors to avail any downside as an opportunity to buy in the banking and exploration and production (E&P) sectors,\u201d the analyst added.\n\nOverall trading volumes increased to 364.4 million shares against Monday\u2019s tally of 261.8 million. The value of shares traded during the day was Rs10.9 billion.\n\nShares of 349 companies were traded, with 174 stocks closing higher, 155 dropping, and 20 remaining unchanged. Bank of Punjab led in volume with trading in 117.02 million shares, gaining Rs0.25 to close at Rs6.27. It was followed by Pakistan International Airlines Corp with 19.3 million shares, gaining Rs0.04 to close at Rs11.10, and K-Electric with 19.2 million shares, losing Rs0.04 to close at Rs4.26.\n\nForeign investors were net sellers of shares worth Rs127.9 million, according to NCPL.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, February 21st, 2024.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",

            "text": "KARACHI: The overwhelming success of the first-ever auction of Ijarah Sukuk on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) in the outgoing week has given rise to speculations that depositors are likely to withdraw their investments from Islamic banks and invest directly in government debt for better returns.\n\nAs opposed to the earlier practice where only commercial banks would place bids for the government debt, its auction on the PSX allows the general public to bypass banks and directly make risk-free investments.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn on Saturday, Meezan Bank Ltd Senior Executive Vice President Ahmed Ali Siddiqui said he doesn\u2019t expect a drop in the deposits of Islamic banks on the pretext of depositors moving their funds from savings accounts to the PSX.\n\n\u201cMost people maintain savings accounts for daily transactions. They don\u2019t keep their money with us for investment purposes,\u201d said the representative of the country\u2019s largest Islamic bank with deposits of over Rs2 trillion.\n\nPakistan Domestic Sukuk Company Ltd, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Ministry of Finance, issued the one-year Ijarah Sukuk with the Islamabad portion of Islamabad Metro as its underlying asset. Unlike conventional debt that\u2019s raised on the word of the sovereign, Ijarah Sukuk generate funds by leasing out physical assets like highways, airports, dams, power plants or large public parks.\n\nInvestors, particularly the general public, participated in the maiden auction so enthusiastically that the realised amount clocked in at a whopping Rs396.3 billion for the offer size of only Rs30bn. The cut-off yield remained 19.5 per cent \u2014 which is 1.9 percentage points lower than the one-year conventional treasury bill cut-off rate of 21.4pc witnessed in the last auction, according to Topline Securities CEO Mohammed Sohail.\n\nMr Siddiqui of Meezan Bank Ltd said depositors of Islamic banks wishing to \u201cinvest\u201d their funds are offered tailor-made products that pay profit rates that\u2019re comparable to other investment options.\n\n\u201cThose products are separate from our savings accounts,\u201d he said, insisting that easier access to direct investment in government debt won\u2019t lead to depositors moving their funds to the PSX.\n\nSpeaking to Dawn, Al Meezan Investment Management Ltd CEO Mohammad Shoaib said the Islamic asset management industry welcomes the auction of Islamic bonds on the PSX platform because it\u2019ll popularise Islamic instruments of debt among the general public.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a misconception that customers of Sharia-compliant asset management companies (AMCs) will switch to direct investing in Sukuk via their brokerage accounts. AMCs are the go-to option for retail investors globally, and Pakistan is no exception,\u201d said the CEO of the AMC with assets under management of roughly Rs400bn.\n\nPublished in Dawn, December 10th, 2023",
