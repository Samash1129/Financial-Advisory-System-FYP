            "text": "Bank Alfalah Limited (PSX: BAFL) has received approval from its Board of Directors to establish an exchange company with an initial paid-up capital of Rs2 billion.\n\nThe bank will raise the required capital by issuing 200 million ordinary shares at a price of Rs10 per share, as revealed in a filing on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday.\n\nThis exchange company will function as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bank Alfalah. However, this decision is subject to approval and clearance from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and other regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nRead This: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nThis move is part of a broader effort to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP is implementing structural reforms in the exchange company sector to strengthen oversight, governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures.\n\nThe SBP has also increased the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the added condition that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nBank Alfalah joins several major banks, including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), and Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), in their pursuit to establish their own forex companies.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

            "text": "KARACHI: The government is set to raise Rs150 billion through the auction of one-, three-, and five-year fixed and floating rate local currency Sukuk, or Islamic bonds, at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on February 20.\n\nA trader can be seen at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) building in Karachi. \u2014 PPI/File\n\nThe auction will be held for five denominations of Sukuk: one-year discounted Government of Pakistan Ijarah Sukuk (GIS), three-year variable rate, three-year fixed rate, five-year variable rate, and five-year fixed rate Sukuk, according to an auction calendar issued by the PSX.\n\nMeezan Bank Limited is leading the transaction as a joint financial adviser and Shariah adviser for the issue of Sukuk, along with Dubai Islamic Bank Pakistan, BankIslami Pakistan Limited, and Bank Alfalah Islamic.\n\nThis will be the third issuance through PSX, after successful issuances in December 2023 and January 2024, where the government was able to raise approximately Rs30 billion and Rs80 billion respectively.\n\nThe Sukuk auction will provide investors an opportunity to invest in a Shariah-compliant instrument and earn returns of up to approximately 20 percent with investments as low as Rs5,000 only.\n\nIn contrast to conventional interest-based Treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds, bankers stated that the government is diversifying its funding sources and reducing considerable debt costs with the successful issuance of Sukuk through the local bourse.\n\nAlong with this, there appears to be a shift towards Shariah-compliant financing, after the Federal Shariat Court's directive to remove Riba/interest from the financial system by December 2027.\n\nBankers said the one-year discounted Ijarah Sukuk will be under fresh issuance, while the issuance of three\n\nand five-year variable and fixed rate bonds will be against the reopening of Sukuk issued in the January 2024\n\nauction. This will be the first time a Sukuk will be reopened through auction at PSX.\n\nReopening of Sukuk is similar to that of issuance of a completely new Sukuk, where the transaction is concluded by purchasing additional shares in the identified asset, which is then leased out via a separate Ijarah agreement executed with the government.\n\nIn case of reopening, the investors bid on the purchase price of the Sukuk instead of the rental rate (which is the usual practice), as the rental rate is kept the same as announced for the initial issue, which is being reopened.\n\nThe underlying asset, maturity date, rental rate, and rental payout frequency of the reopened Sukuk are kept the same as that of the initial issue.",

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

They truly are leaders in all respects in Pakistan\u2019s corporate sector.\n\nThe PSX Top 25 Companies Awards recognize companies achieving certain key pre-requisites for this prestigious award, which include having a minimum dividend distribution of 30 percent and shares of the company having been traded at least 75 percent of the total trading days in a year, among other pre-requisites.\n\nSubject to achieving these pre-requisites, the companies are further weighed based on certain quantitative and qualitative criteria.

            "text": "The Ministry of Finance is preparing for an auction of sovereign Sukuk bonds, totaling Rs 100 billion at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on January 23, 2024.\n\nThere will be five types of Sukuk bonds up for auction, with durations of 1, 3, and 5 years. These bonds are attractive to both individual and large-scale investors.\n\nThe Islamabad International Airport, valued at over Rs 203 billion, including its buildings, infrastructure, and land (spanning 26,313 Kanals and 4 Marlas), serves as the asset backing these bonds.\n\nThe auction includes a one-year fixed-rate Ijarah Sukuk, three-year Ijarah Sukuks in both fixed and variable rates, and five-year Ijarah Sukuks with similar options. The one-year Sukuk will be sold at a discount, while the three and five-year Sukuks will be sold at their full face value.\n\nThe rental rate for these Sukuks will be decided based on the auction\u2019s outcome. Meezan Bank Limited, together with Dubai Islamic Bank, Bank Alfalah Islamic, and BankIslami Pakistan Limited, is advising on both the financial and Shariah aspects of this auction.\n\nThis auction follows a one-year Sukuk auction in December 2023, where the government raised Rs 30 billion, attracting subscriptions over 12 times the initial offering. This past success allowed the government to secure funds at a rate 3% below the policy rates. As a result, the government is now offering more Sukuk bonds at PSX to reduce borrowing costs.\n\nThe Security and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), the Central Depository Company of Pakistan Limited (NCCPL), and the PSX are working with the Ministry of Finance to facilitate this Sukuk launch.",

            "text": "After a volatile session at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), strong corporate results helped stocks stage a final-hour rally, pushing the benchmark KSE-100 beyond 62,000 with an over 400-point gain on Thursday.\n\nDuring most part of the day, the benchmark index had remained largely range-bound.\n\nHowever, it picked up traction in the final hour of trading, and at close, the benchmark index settled at 62,393.73, an increase of 414.55 points or 0.67%.\n\nExperts said investor sentiment improved after strong corporate results especially by the index-heavy banking and energy sectors.\n\nShares of index-heavy energy stocks including OGDC and PPL closed in the green alongside scrips of Bank Alfalah and Soneri Bank, which posted significant profit growth.\n\nAt close on Wednesday, the benchmark index retreated amid late selling to close at 61,979.18, an increase of 137.44 points or 0.22%.\n\nExperts said that the market is keenly awaiting the polls, and a rally is expected post-elections.\n\n\u201cThe General Elections 2024 are expected to be held on 8th Feb\u201924, and transition of power to the newly elected government is expected to increase investor confidence in the market,\u201d said Arif Habib Limited (AHL) in a report on Thursday.\n\n\u201cWith the ongoing result season, certain scrips are expected to remain in the limelight on the expectation of robust results,\u201d it added.\n\nPRL posts PAT of over Rs2bn profit in 2QFY24\n\nGlobally, the Asian shares faltered on Thursday after Wall Street took a late spill, while investors stuck to bets for sizable cuts in US interest rates this year even if the kick-off might now be a little later than first hoped.\n\nThe Federal Reserve committee\u2019s decision to hold rates at 5.25-5.5% on Wednesday was no surprise, it took a dovish twist by emphasising that rates would not be cut until it had more confidence that inflation was truly beaten.\n\nIn a media conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell flatly stated a cut as early as March seemed unlikely, but also conceded that everyone on the committee was looking to ease this year.\n\nVolume on the all-share index decreased to 270.5 million from 276.4 million a session before.\n\nThe value of shares increased to Rs11.62 billion from Rs9.27 billion in the previous session.\n\nK-Electric Ltd was the volume leader with 34 million shares, followed by Soneri Bank Ltd with 28.1 million shares, and Pak Refinery at 26.1 million shares.\n\nShares of 346 companies were traded on Thursday, of which 166 registered an increase, 154 recorded a fall, while 26 remained unchanged.",

The Bank has crossed significant milestones of 1,000 branches and Rs. 2 trillion in deposits, improving its industry ranking in terms of deposit base, total assets and branch footprint. The Bank posted a profit after tax of Rs. 36.456 billion as compared to Rs. 18.206 billion last year, showing over 100% growth. The earnings per share (EPS) stands at Rs 23.12 (2022: Rs 10.27).\n\nThis reflects strong growth momentum in line with the Bank\u2019s strategy. The Board of Directors has declared final cash dividend of Rs 5.00 per share (50%). This is in addition to an interim cash dividend of Rs 3.00 (30%).\n\nDeposits closed at Rs 2.085 trillion as at December 31, 2023, representing a 40.2% increase over the previous year. This performance is a clear depiction of the Bank\u2019s focus on improving the deposit base while having customer-centricity at the forefront, and a diversified product suite catering to market demand.\n\nThe Bank reported its advances at Rs 777.287 billion while upholding robust credit discipline amid challenging market conditions, and has sufficient provision against non-performing loans with coverage of 112.2%, including general provision.\n\nThe Bank exercises sound capital management and remains adequately capitalised with CAR at 16.74% as at December 31, 2023, well above the regulatory requirement. Bank Alfalah\u2019s foremost goal is to deliver unparalleled services to its valued customers, grow market share, and extend its footprint while expanding its reach to a broader audience. Responding to ever-changing business dynamics, the Bank is expediting its digital transformation journey, and also opened Pakistan\u2019s first \u2018Digital Lifestyle\u2019 branch in 2023.\n\nThis goes hand in hand with the Bank\u2019s commitment to positively impact the community and be sustainable. As a testament to its performance, the Bank received many awards, including \u2018Best Digital Banking\u2019 by PBA and \u2018Top 25 Companies\u2019 by PSX. Moving forward, the Bank is looking to enhance its customers\u2019 experience further while leveraging core competencies.\n\nIt remains poised for adaptability, resilience, and sustained value creation, ensuring enduring shareholder value and continued excellence in the face of evolving challenges.\n\nCopyright Business Recorder, 2024",

            "text": "KARACHI: The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) will host its first-ever auction of a one-year listed local currency sukuk on December 8 (Friday) to diversify government funding sources, boost Islamic finance, and develop a Shariah-compliant capital market.\n\nThe government plans to raise a total of Rs90 billion through three government Ijarah sukuk auctions between December 2023 and February 2024, according to the dates and target size released by the exchange. On Friday, there will be the first auction.\n\nA currency exchange dealer counts dollar bills in this image. \u2014 AFP/File\n\nThe sovereign sukuk will be backed by Islamabad Metro (Islamabad Portion) and use the Ijarah structure, a sharia-compliant sale and lease-back of underlying assets. The joint financial and Shariah advisors for the issuance are Meezan Bank Limited, Dubai Islamic Bank (Pakistan) Limited, BankIslami Pakistan Limited, and Bank Alfalah Limited.\n\nAccording to information provided by PSX, all eligible investors are those who meet the requirements outlined in the Government of Pakistan Sukuk Rules 2008 (amended in 2023) and as announced by the Ministry of Finance on November 17, 2023. These include individuals, institutions, trusts, funds of all kinds, corporate bodies such as banks and non-banking finance companies, insurance, and Takaful companies, regardless of their residential status.\n\nInternational Islamic banks and financial institutions, foreign investors, non-resident Pakistanis, and Roshan digital account holders are all eligible to bid in the auction.\n\nAccording to analysts, the launch of a listed sukuk via the local exchange will contribute to the development of the Islamic bond market in the country and draw retail investors to investments that adhere to Shariah. Additionally, this will encourage the government to rely more on the issuance of Islamic debt instruments rather than conventional ones to raise funds. But to effectively promote this sukuk, the government must hold roadshows and awareness campaigns.\n\n\u201cIn a major development, the government of Pakistan has decided to conduct a 1-year Ijarah Sukuk Auction at Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday (Dec 8, 2023),\u201d said Mohammed Sohail, the CEO at Topline Securities.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time that such a #bond auction will happen at PSX. Earlier banks used to do this,\u201d he added. \u201cThe government is targeting to raise Rs30 billion ($105 million) through 1-year Islamic paper at discount (zero coupons). These bonds will also trade at PSX and will help in the much-needed development of the bond market in Pakistan,\u201d Sohail said.\n\n\u201cNow, thousands of retail investors who invest in stocks through Brokers can also buy these sukuks. We expect the yield on these sukuks to be between 20-22 percent in Friday auction.\u201d There are certain obstacles in the way of Pakistan's Islamic debt market's growth and development. The largest obstacle is still converting public debt into instruments that comply with Shariah. Up until recently, a significant barrier to the regular issuing of asset-based Sukuk was the absence of sufficient sovereign assets, according to analysts.",
