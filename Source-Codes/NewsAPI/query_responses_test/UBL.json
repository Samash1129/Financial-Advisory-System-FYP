However, this decision is subject to approval and clearance from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and other regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nRead This: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nThis move is part of a broader effort to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP is implementing structural reforms in the exchange company sector to strengthen oversight, governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures.\n\nThe SBP has also increased the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the added condition that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nBank Alfalah joins several major banks, including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), and Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), in their pursuit to establish their own forex companies.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

            "text": "KARACHI: The stock market started trading on a bullish note on the first day of the week but the growing political uncertainty and its likely fallouts triggered selling by some worried investors as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index closed in the red.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the equities floated in both directions. Initially, the index made an intraday high of 555 points to 65,069 level. However, profit-taking at the aforesaid level compelled the benchmark index to lose earlier gains before recording an intraday low of 331 points to 64,184.\n\nDue to increasing political noise on the holding of upcoming general elections on Feb 8, investors opted to trim their equity positions by booking profit in selective stocks of banks, exploration and production, tech and OMC sectors.\n\nResultantly, United Bank Ltd, Pakistan Petro\u00adle\u00adum, Oil and Gas Develo\u00adpment Company Ltd, TRG Pakistan Ltd and PSO lost 200 points, cumulatively.\n\nOn the flip side, Engro Corporation, Engro Fertili\u00adsers Ltd and Dawood Hercules Corporation Ltd collectively added 269 points due to rejuvenated buying interest in them.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said pre-poll uncertainty ahead of the IMF board meeting, which is scheduled for Jan 11, on its first review under the $3bn Stand-By Arrangement did add to the investor nervousness.\n\nAlso, doubts were growing about a cut in the SBP policy rate in the wake of surging inflation and concerns for geo-political tensions played a catalyst role in the bearish close of the market.\n\nThe KSE-100 index closed at 64,237.03 points after losing 277.87 points or 0.43 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume plunged by 49.02pc to 484.01 million shares. The traded value also dipped 93.41pc to Rs12.74bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included K-Electric Ltd (168.81m shares), Worldcall Telecom Ltd (21.98m shares), Pakistan International Airlines Cor\u00adporation (17.94m shares), Pakistan Telecommuni\u00adcation Company Ltd (17.77m shares) and Cnergiyco PK Ltd (15.69m shares).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Pak Suzuki Motor Company Ltd (Rs50.46), Reliance Cotton Spinning Mills Ltd (Rs35.00), JDW Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs33.69), Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs29.90) and Sapphire Textile Mills Ltd (Rs20.00).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Nestle Pakistan Ltd (Rs150.00), Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs135.00), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs22.60), Service Industries Ltd (Rs17.03) and Al-Abbas Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs13.00).\n\nForeign investors were net buyers as they purchased shares worth $0.16m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 9th, 2024",

MCB Bank Limited, Meezan Bank Limited, and United Bank Limited (UBL) have also announced they would establish an EC as a wholly-owned subsidiary.\n\nEarlier this month, the SBP, in its bid to strengthen controls amid the massive fall in rupee\u2019s value in the open market, decided to introduce \u2018structural reforms\u2019 in the EC sector.\n\n\u201cAs part of these reforms, leading banks actively engaged in foreign exchange business will establish wholly-owned Exchange Companies (EC) to cater to the legitimate foreign exchange needs of general public,\u201d said the SBP in a statement.\n\nFurther, the SBP also raised the minimum capital requirement for EC from Rs200 million to Rs500 million, raising the barrier to entry for the private sector.\n\nAs per Faysal Bank\u2019s latest financial results, the bank declared a consolidated profit before tax (PBT) of Rs7.66 billion for the first half of 2023 (January-June), nearly 76% higher than the Rs4.36 billion recorded in the same period of the previous year.\n\nFaysal Bank announced earnings per share (EPS) of Rs5.05, as compared to EPS of Rs2.87 in SPLY. In addition, the Board of Directors of Faysal Bank Limited announced an interim cash dividend of Re1 per share of Rs10 each i.e. 10%.",

            "text": "KARACHI: The stock market turned in a cautious performance on Monday ahead of the monetary policy announcement as a result the benchmark index managed to post modest gains with a sharp contraction in the trading volume.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the equities kicked off the week on a positive note as the benchmark KSE 100 index rose 332 to 65,148 points in early trade amid hopes of a positive outcome of the ongoing IMF final review under the current $3bn Stand-By Arran\u00adgement, which would pave the way for the release of last tranche of $1.1bn.\n\nHowever, the uncertain interest rate outlook unsettled a section of investors who resorted to profit-taking at the day\u2019s high level resultantly the index lost some of its initial gains.\n\nThe equity investors adopted a cautious approach ahead of the monetary policy announcement, which was to be unveiled later in the day. A majority of market pundits were expecting a status quo given the ongoing IMF review of the economy and spike in Ramazan-driven inflationary pressure.\n\nFertiliser, banks and power sectors contributed positively to the index as Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank Ltd, Hub Power, United Bank Ltd Dawood Hercules cumulatively added 141 points to the index. On the other hand, Lucky Cement, Systems Ltd and MCB Bank came under heavy selling wiping out 72 points.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said the surging global crude oil prices and strong rupee helped the market to remain in the green.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,890.51 points after gaining 74.04 points or 0.11 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading tumbled 18.35pc to 211.75 million shares. The traded value also declined 23.07pc to Rs7.78bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included WorldCall Telecom (16.60m shares), Hascol Petroleum Ltd (16.26m shares), Telecard Ltd (14.67m shares), PTCL (13.81m shares) and K-Electric (12.95m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Pakistan Hotels (Rs19.98), Pakistan Tobacco (Rs11.00), Thal Ltd (Rs8.98), KASB Pumps (Rs5.20) and Bolan Castings (Rs6.46).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Ismail Industries (Rs60.00), Sapphire Fibres Ltd (Rs35.83), JDW Sugar (Rs20.90), Colgate Palm\u00adolive (Rs19.17) and Sazgar Engineering (Rs15.64).\n\nForeign investors rema\u00adined net buyers as they purchased shares worth $0.39m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 19th, 2024",

On the flip side, United Bank Ltd, Nestle Pakistan, Colgate-Palmolive, Dawood Hercules and Pakistan Oilfield Ltd took away 88 points.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said speculations about a breakthrough in negotiations between PML-N and Pakistan Peoples Party over a coalition government power-sharing formula later in the day eased political instability fuelling a sharp recovery at the PSX.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 60,459.75 points after adding 586.79 points or 0.98 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume dipped 16.68pc to 261.79 million shares.
