            "text": "Faysal Bank Limited (PSX: FABL) announced on Thursday to set up a fully-owned exchange company with an initial capital injection of Rs 1 billion.\n\nThis move aligns with the provisions outlined in Sections 96 and 131 of the Securities Act, 2015, and Regulation 5.6.1 of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) Rule Book.\n\nDuring a board meeting held on September 27, 2023, Faysal Bank Limited\u2019s board of directors approved the establishment of an exchange company, starting with an initial paid-up capital of Rs 1 billion, pending clearance and approval from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), bank\u2019s filing in the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) said.\n\nThis development follows recent efforts to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP has pledged to institute structural reforms in the exchange company sector, emphasizing the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe primary aim of this crackdown is to enhance oversight of the open market and strengthen governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures within the sector. The minimum capital requirement for exchange companies has been raised from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional requirement that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that Faysal Bank Limited joins the ranks of major banks keen on participating in this transformative shift. United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), and Allied Bank Limited (ABL) have all recently indicated their intentions to establish their own forex companies.\n\nHabib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had already ventured into exchange companies before the introduction of these new regulatory measures by the SBP.",

            "text": "Faysal Bank Limited (PSX: FABL) announced earnings (PAT) today for 3QCY23 at Rs. 4.65 billion (EPS: Rs. 3.06), depicting an increase of 34 percent year-on-year (YoY) or 7 percent QoQ (3QCY22 EPS: Rs. 2.28).\n\nThis jump in overall earnings was mainly on the back of growth in net profit earned, according to Arif Habib Limited. On a sequential basis, higher provisioning impacted the overall profitability.\n\nAlong with the result, FABL announced a DPS of Rs. 1 in 3QCY23, taking the 9MCY23 dividend to Rs. 2 per share.\n\nALSO READ UBL Posts Highest Ever Profit of Rs. 42 Billion in First 9 Months of 2023\n\nNet profit earned by the bank settled at Rs. 18.4 billion during 3QCY23, increasing 72 percent YoY and 4 percent QoQ. With this, the total net profit earned for 9MCY23 went up to Rs. 49 billion, marking an 83 percent YoY jump. Profit earned saw a jump of 89 percent during 9MCY23 while profit expensed was up by 93 percent.\n\nDuring 3QCY23, NFI reported a 2 percent YoY and a 3 percent QoQ growth, bringing the total NFI for 9MCY23 to Rs. 7.5 billion, a 6 percent YoY increase. This growth in 3QCY23 was mainly attributed to a substantial 50 percent YoY surge in fee income. However, there were declines in other areas, with FX income decreasing by 53 percent and losses on securities rising by 77 percent YoY to Rs. 553 million during 3QCY23.\n\nOn a sequential basis, fee income increased by 11 percent, while dividend and FX income declined by 86 percent and 23 percent, respectively.\n\nThe bank\u2019s provisioning in 3QCY23 amounted to Rs. 1.6 billion, in contrast to provisioning reversals of Rs. 330 million reported in the SPLY. However, when comparing it on a QoQ basis, there was a significant 68 percent increase in the provisioning charge. This brings the total provisioning for 9MCY23 to Rs. 3.9 billion, significantly higher than the provisioning reversal of Rs. 736 million during the same period last year.\n\nThe bank\u2019s OPEX increased 44 percent YoY in 3QCY23 clocking in at Rs. 10 billion (3QCY22: Rs. 6.97 billion). With this, Cost/Income stood at 48.3 percent in 3QCY23 against 53 percent same period last year. The effective tax rate was set at 50 percent during 3QCY23 compared to 51 percent last quarter.\n\nFABL\u2019s scrip at the bourse closed at Rs. 24.39, down by 3.56 percent or Rs. 0.9 with a turnover of 5,884,340 shares on Thursday.",

            "text": "The country\u2019s commercial banks are continuing to create their own exchange companies months after a massive crackdown on Pakistan\u2019s currency market.\n\nThe latest in the list is Faysal Bank, which has inched closer towards launching its own exchange company. On January 17, 2024, Faysal Bank notified the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) that it had received a \u2018Certificate of Incorporation\u2019 for its exchange company subsidiary.\n\nThis was the culmination of a process that began on September 28, 2023, when the bank announced its intention to set up a fully-owned exchange company with an initial capital of Rs 1 billion. The bank\u2019s board of directors had given their approval for the project on September 27, 2023, subject to the clearance and approval of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), as per the bank\u2019s filing on the PSX.\n\nThe bank crossed the first milestone when it obtained a no-objection certificate (NOC) from the SBP on November 1, 2023, for establishing an exchange company named \u2018Faysal Islami Currency Exchange Company (Private) Limited\u2019.\n\nPreviously, Meezan Bank received a certificate of incorporation from SECP for its exchange subsidiary, Meezan Exchange Company (Pvt.) Limited on November 14, 2023. Meezan Bank informed via PSX notification that it would submit an application to SBP for the issuance of a license to commence operations, as per the SBP Exchange Companies Manual.\n\nWhy are banks setting up exchange companies?\n\nIn early September, the SBP made a decisive move, signalling that it had had enough. It unfurled a sweeping set of reforms targeting exchange companies.\n\nUnder the new reforms, banks were asked to set up exchange companies. \u201cLeading banks actively engaged in foreign exchange business will establish wholly owned Exchange Companies to cater to the legitimate foreign exchange needs of the general public,\u201d read the press release.\n\nA source disclosed to Profit that the SBP with the full force of the state had been involved in a crackdown on exchange companies. As such the top 10 banks were asked to open exchange companies. While the National Bank of Pakistan and Habib Bank already had exchange companies, Meezan Bank, Allied Bank, Habib Metropolitan Bank, Bank Alfalah, Faysal Bank, Askari Bank and Bank Al Habib were also ordered to set them up. The orders \u201ccame from the very top\u201d, the source said.\n\nRead: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve?\n\nUnited Bank wasted no time in announcing its venture into the exchange company arena on September 12, six days after the reforms were rolled out. UBL\u2019s move triggered a domino effect, with a lineup of other banks swiftly joining the fray. Meezan Bank joined the list three days later. In the following weeks, more banks followed suit which included MCB Bank, Bank A lHabib, Allied Bank, and Faysal Bank.\n\nReforms in the exchange companies sector\n\nThe primary objective of these reforms was tightening control over the open market and fortifying governance, internal controls, and compliance standards within the sector. The reforms came a little over a year after the SBP suspended the operations of several branches and franchises of exchange companies over regulatory violations. The central bank had launched a crackdown against exchange companies on apprehensions that they were not selling foreign currency to customers despite availability, leading to exchange rate volatility and a wide difference in rates offered in the interbank market and those quoted by the companies and commercial banks.\n\nPreviously, exchange companies in category A had a higher minimum capital requirement \u2014 Rs 20 crore \u2014 while those in category B had a lower minimum capital requirement of Rs 2.5 crore. The latter could only act as money changers.\n\nUnder the reforms, all exchange companies in categories A and B along with franchises of exchange companies were to be consolidated and transformed into a single category with a well-defined mandate.\n\nThe minimum capital requirement for exchange companies for category A was bumped up from Rs 20 crore to Rs 50 crore, free of losses.\n\nCategory B exchange companies were given three options: merge with an existing exchange company, upgrade to full exchange company status, or consolidate with other category B exchange companies to form a unified entity. They had to approach the SBP within one month for a NOC for one of these choices. After receiving the NOC, they had three months to meet regulatory and legal requirements for formal licensing, failing which, their licences would be cancelled.\n\nSimilarly, franchises of exchange companies were given two options: either merge with the franchiser exchange company or sell the franchise to it. They had one month to seek the approval of the central bank for the merger or sale. The failure to do so would result in cancellation of licenses.",

According to Arif Habib Limited, this is FABL\u2019s highest-ever profit after tax, fueled by a surge in profit earned spurred by a 600 bps hike in interest rates during the year.\n\nThis jump in overall earnings was mainly on the back of growth in total income.\n\nFABL posted its highest ever profit after tax of PKR 20.2bn, marking a YoY jump of 77%. This unprecedented profitability was mainly fueled by surge in profit earned spurred by a 600bps hike in interest rates during the year.@Pakstockexgltd @StateBank_Pak @Faysalbankltd#KSE100\u2026 pic.twitter.com/5GOz4YFn42 \u2014 Arif Habib Limited (@ArifHabibLtd) February 7, 2024\n\nALSO READ MCB Bank Posts Its Highest Ever Annual Profit in 2023\n\nNet Profit Earned by the bank clocked in at Rs. 21.9 billion during 4QCY23, increasing 68 percent YoY and 19 percent QoQ.

This jump in NFI during CY23 was primarily due to higher fee and commission income which posted a jump of 30 percent YoY, clocking in at Rs. 9.4 billion. Moreover, FX income too was significantly up 67 percent in CY23, reaching Rs. 4.8 billion. However, FABL posted a loss on securities of Rs. 1.8 billion as compared to a loss of Rs. 1.5 billion recorded in SPLY.\n\nFABL booked provisioning reversals of Rs. 2.8 billion during 4QCY23 (4QCY22 reversals: Rs. 204 million) depicting a significant jump of 13x on a YoY basis. This takes the total provisioning to Rs. 1.2 billion during CY23 (CY22 reversals: Rs. 940 million).\n\nThe bank\u2019s OPEX increased 55 percent YoY in 4QCY23 clocking in at Rs. 13 billion (4QCY22: Rs. 8.3 billion). With this, Cost/Income stood at 47.2 percent in 4QCY23 against 54 percent same period last year.\n\nThe effective tax rate was set at 54 percent during 4QCY23 compared to 51 percent SPLY. With this, the effective tax for CY23 stood at 52 percent (CY22: 50 percent).\n\nALSO READ International Packaging Films Asks PSX to Again Officially Approve Its IPO\n\nFABL reported earnings per share (EPS) of Rs. 13.34 for 2023 compared to an EPS of Rs. 7.54 in SPLY.\n\nMian Muhammad Younis, Chairman of Faysal Bank on this occasion said: \u201cThis significant milestone marks a reaffirmation of trust and confidence reposed in us by our customers.\u201d He added that \u201cWe look forward to continuing this journey of excellence, innovation, and best in class Shariah Compliant Islamic Banking, ensuring a positive impact on all our stakeholders.\u201d\n\nYousaf Hussain, President & CEO of Faysal Bank said: \u201cWe are grateful for the unwavering support from all our stakeholders, which has been a driving force behind this unprecedented journey of growth of Faysal Bank. It is our aspiration to not only sustain this momentum but to elevate Faysal Bank to the pinnacle of excellence in Islamic Banking whist focusing on our strong and growing customer base and through our customer centric products and services.\u201d\n\nBesides the result, FABL announced a final cash dividend of Rs. 2 per share of Rs. 10 each for CY23. This is in addition to the 10 percent interim cash dividend for the second quarter ended June 30, 2023, and the 10 percent dividend for the third quarter ended September 30, 2023, already paid to shareholders.",

            "text": "The Bank of Khyber (PSX: BOK) announced on Friday that it will set up a wholly-owned Exchange Company with an initial paid-up capital of up to Rs1 billion.\n\nIn a stock filing on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), the BOK stated that its board had approved the establishment of an exchange company during their meeting held on November 03, 2023.\n\nHowever, the board\u2019s decision is subject to approval and clearance by the SBP and the completion of other regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nRead This: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nBOK\u2019s initiative is a crucial component of a wider campaign by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) aimed at curbing illicit activities within the underground market.\n\nThe SBP has recently introduced structural reforms within the exchange company sector to enhance regulatory oversight, bolster governance frameworks, fortify internal controls, and tighten compliance protocols.\n\nFurthermore, the SBP has raised the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional stipulation that the capital must be unencumbered by prior losses.\n\nEarlier, major banks including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), Bank Alfalah (BAFL), Habib Metropolitan Bank, Askari Bank Limited and Bank of Punjab announced their plans to establish their own forex companies.\n\nThe SBP issued no-objection certificate (NOC) to ABL and MCB for establishing their exchange companies. Allied Bank\u2019s exchange company will be named ABL Exchange Company (Private) Limited and MCB\u2019s as MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",
