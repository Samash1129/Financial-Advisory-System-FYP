            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Share prices of Islamic banks took a beating on Monday, thanks to Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar\u2019s recent statement that customers are getting short-changed by Sharia-compliant lenders by way of insufficient returns on deposits.\n\nSpeaking to a TV host, Dr Akhtar said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) should review the issue of minimum deposit rate (MDR) \u2014 a provision that Islamic banks are currently exempted from.\n\nWith every new finance minister in Islamabad comes a fresh wave of measures aimed at shifting money from the bottom lines of banks to the national exchequer. But for the first time in many years, there\u2019s a proposal on the cards that, if adopted, will transfer money from (Islamic) banks to customers.\n\nBack in 2008 when the current finance minister held the position of SBP governor, the regulator directed banks, including Islamic ones, to pay minimum profit rates on savings accounts. Even though Islamic banks were exempted from the provision in subsequent years, conventional banks are still required to pay a certain rate on all savings accounts.\n\nThe MDR is 150 basis points less than the prevailing benchmark interest rate. In other words, every conventional bank is bound to pay an interest rate of 20.5 per cent to its savings account holders as long as the key interest rate remains 22pc.\n\nAccording to Arif Habib Ltd analyst Sana Tawfik, Islamic banks have been exempted from this requirement to promote Sharia-compliant banking in the country.\n\nAmong the three full-fledged Islamic banks listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), the proportion of savings deposits in their total deposits stood at 40pc for Meezan Bank Ltd, 42pc for Faysal Bank Ltd and 25pc for BankIslami Pakistan Ltd at the end of the September quarter, according to Ms Tawfik.\n\nA sensitivity analysis conducted by her brokerage showed that a 1pc increase in the cost of savings deposits will reduce the earnings per share of Meezan Bank Ltd by Rs2.27, Faysal Bank Ltd by Rs1.35 and BankIslami Pakistan Ltd by Rs0.53.\n\nA research report written by JS Global Head of Research Amreen Soorani stated that Islamic banks are currently offering savings rates that are between seven and 9.5 percentage points lower than the MDR offered by conventional banks.\n\n\u201cThe recent sharp rise in interest rates has widened the said spread, which used to range between 300-500 basis points previously,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, a lender like Meezan Bank Ltd with an outsize market share within the Islamic banking industry is expected to successfully counter the negative impact of the MDR for a host of reasons, she said.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019ll be able to mobilise higher deposits by offering the same returns that are being offered by its conventional peers. \u201cThis would likely boost the volumetric growth of the bank\u2019s deposit base,\u201d she said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 28th, 2023",
