            "text": "KARACHI: Share prices fell sharply in the second half of Friday\u2019s trading session on the stock market amid selling pressure emanating from uncertainty on monetary policy stance and the government\u2019s plans to reduce circular debt and industrial power tariff, as a result the benchmark KSE 100 index settled below 64,000 level.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said stocks fell on pre-poll uncertainty and investor concerns for unresolved power sector circular debt, which rose to Rs2.55 trillion in the first half of FY24.\n\nHe said the uncertainty over IMF approval on the SIFC directive for the Rs1.27tr circular debt settlement plan and weak industrial earnings outlook amid surging gas tariff played a catalyst role in the bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd said the benchmark index opened on a positive note posting an intraday high of 236 points, but pressure was observed in the second half on account of profit-taking by investors in banks ahead of the monetary policy committee meeting due on Monday.\n\nOil and Gas Development Company Ltd, HabibMetro Bank, Indus Motor, Allied Bank Ltd and Lucky Core Industries cumulatively added 154 points to the index. On the flip side, Mari Petroleum, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank, Habib Bank and Bank Alhabib Ltd lost value to weigh down on the index by 226 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 63,813.06 points after shedding 484.94 points or 0.75 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume further dipped by 10.39pc to 412.82 million shares. The traded value also plunged by 35.89pc to Rs16.18bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan International Airline Corporation Ltd (66.17m shares), K-Electric (47.10m shares), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (31.07m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (20.13m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (18.82m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Atlas Honda Ltd (Rs28.52), Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs25.42), JS Global Capital Ltd (Rs11.64), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs11.45) and JDW Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs10.00).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs400.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs82.29), Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs44.89), Siemens Pakistan Ltd (Rs32.01) and Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs25.00).\n\nForeign investors indulged in aggressive selling as they disposed of shares worth $10.05m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 27th, 2024",

            "text": "KARACHI: Habib Bank Limited Wednesday declared another record quarterly profit for Q3\u201923 with a profit before tax (PBT) of Rs 32.0 billion.\n\nThe Bank\u2019s consolidated PBT of Rs 83.5 billion for the nine months of 2023 was 50% higher than the PBT for 9M\u201922. Despite continued excessive taxation on the banking sector, the Bank\u2019s profit after tax (PAT) for 9M\u201923 grew by 82% to Rs 43.0 billion over the same period last year.\n\nEarnings per share for the first nine months were Rs 29.20 compared to Rs 15.95 for 9M\u201922. Along with the results, the Bank declared an interim cash dividend of Rs 2.25 per share (22.50%).\n\nThis is in addition to the Interim Cash Dividend already paid at Rs 3.50 per share (35%).\n\nHBL\u2019s fortress balance sheet grew by 19% over December 2022 to cross Rs 5.5 trillion, on the back of robust deposit growth. Domestic deposits grew by more than Rs 400 billion over December 2022 and now stand at Rs 3.3 trillion; HBL\u2019s total deposits reached ~Rs4.0 trillion.\n\nDuring the quarter, domestic advances increased by 5%; even in the face of macroeconomic headwinds, Consumer loans grew by Rs 4 billion over December 2022, agriculture lending touched new highs and microfinance loans increased by 12%.\n\nThe impact of rising rates continues to flow through to asset prices; the average domestic balance sheet grew by Rs 433 billion, while net interest margins improved by 194 bps.\n\nThis was well supported by substantially higher interest income from the international business. Consequently, HBL\u2019s total net interest income grew by 53% to Rs 178 billion.\n\nTrade, consumer finance and cash management also made solid contributions, delivering high double-digit fee growth. Total fees increased by 34% to Rs 30 billion, and the Bank\u2019s total revenue for the first nine months of 2023 increased by 42%, to Rs 216 billion.\n\nDespite record inflationary levels, proactive cost management and strong revenue growth enabled us to reduce the cost/income ratio from 60.0% in 9M\u201922 to 57.1% in 9M\u201923. With the growth in loans during the quarter, the infection ratio reverted down to 5% from 5.5% in Q2\u201923.\n\nPrudent provisioning has ensured that coverage remains in excess of 100%. The strong profitability also improved the Bank\u2019s Capital Adequacy Ratio by 91 bps, to 16.1%.\n\nCommenting on the Bank\u2019s performance, Muhammad Aurangzeb, President & CEO - HBL said, \u201cHBL had a record quarter, driven by excellent results across all domestic business segments and a further improvement in profitability from the international franchise.\n\nThe Bank continues to provide innovative products and financial solutions to its clients whilst promoting sustainable practices within the HBL community and across the financial services industry.\n\n\u201cWe are investing in cutting-edge methods, practices and technologies to support Pakistani farmers and address the related challenges of agriculture, food security, and climate change.\n\nIn Q3\u201923 HBL became a signatory of the UN Principles of Responsible Banking; this commitment will help us accelerate the transition to a net zero economy. The Bank\u2019s Impact & Sustainability Report \u2013 2022 illustrates the new standards for sustainable banking that we are setting in Pakistan, on our journey to being \u201cMore Than Just a Bank\u201d.\u201d\n\nBUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS\n\nHBL\u2019s digital channels continue to play a significant role in shaping Pakistan\u2019s financial landscape, connecting both clients and businesses.HBL Mobile, and Konnect by HBL\u2019s user base expanded to over 4 million users, resulting in 49% more digital transactions than to the same period last year.\n\nThis led to over Rs 1.3 trillion processed by our mobile apps, double the amount in Q3\u201922.\n\nHBL\u2019s mission is to rapidly digitalize the payments landscape of Pakistan.

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Lucky Cement Ltd has completed a second share buyback exercise representing 6.5 per cent of its paid-up capital at spot prices, the company said on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to data compiled by Arif Habib Ltd, the cement maker\u2019s average purchase price was Rs632.60 per share for 20.375 million shares that it bought between June 2 and Nov 20.\n\nAs a result, the share buyback cost the company a total of Rs12.9 billion, which makes it the biggest exercise of its kind conducted on the Pakistan Stock Exchange.\n\nThe company completed its first buyback round consisting of 10m shares back in March at a total cost of Rs4.35bn. The stated purpose of the buyback exercise is to cancel the shares after acquiring them using the company\u2019s distributable profits.\n\nMany listed companies have carried out share repurchase exercises in the ready market in the recent past. The total number of shares goes down once a company conducts a buyback, leading to an increase in its earnings per share as well as its break-up value \u2014 the amount that the company would be worth if it was liquidated.\n\nCompanies that have completed share buybacks in recent months include Netsol Technologies Ltd, JDW Sugar Mills Ltd, Bank Alfalah Ltd, Engro Corporation Ltd, Kohat Cement Company Ltd, Habib Bank Ltd and Kohinoor Textile Mills Ltd.\n\nSome analysts believe the reduction in the volume of tradeable shares is bad for the stock market. Others say the exercise provides investors with a higher-than-usual share price to liquidate their investments.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 22nd, 2023",

            "text": "KARACHI: After a robust overnight rally, the stock market came under renewed profit-selling by nervous investors amid growing economic uncertainty as a result the benchmark KSE 100-share index settled below the 65,000 level on Friday.\n\nAhsan Mehanti of Arif Habib Corporation said challenges over external financing, uncertainty about the outcome of the ongoing IMF review and status quo expectations in the monetary policy announcement on March 18 amid SPI inflation surging 32.89pc year-on-year played a catalyst role in the bearish close.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd attributed the market volatility to news reports that the IMF mission has expressed displeasure over the Ministry of Finance\u2019s verdict that it had materialised all structural benchmarks before the completion of the review by the visiting mission.\n\nThe major positive contribution came from Engro Fertilisers, Meezan Bank Ltd, Lucky Cement, National Bank of Pakistan, Mari Petroleum Ltd and Systems Ltd, which cumulatively added 135 points to the index. On the other hand, Oil and Gas Development Company, Hub Power, Pakistan Petroleum Ltd, Bank Al-Habib, United Bank Ltd and PSO wiped out 179 points.\n\nThe index traded between its intraday high of 289 points and low of 248 points. As a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,816.47 points after losing 247.80 points or 0.38 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading dipped 17.72pc to 259.37 million shares. The traded value also declined 3.49pc to Rs10.12bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Hascol Petroleum Ltd (56.95m shares), Cnergyico PK Ltd (19.63m shares), WorldCall Telecom (16.54m shares), Telecard Ltd (9.77m shares) and Bank of Punjab (9.03m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs100.00), Indus Motor Ltd (Rs21.86), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs15.97), Sazgar Engineering Works Ltd (Rs14.02) and Pakistan Services Ltd (Rs13.01).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Premium Textile Mills Ltd (Rs24.50), Mehmood Textile Mills Ltd (Rs16.67), Services Industries Ltd (Rs11.88), Packages Ltd (Rs10.82) and The Thal Industries Corporation Ltd(Rs10.20).\n\nForeign investors remained net sellers as they offloaded shares worth $0.29m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, March 16th, 2024",
