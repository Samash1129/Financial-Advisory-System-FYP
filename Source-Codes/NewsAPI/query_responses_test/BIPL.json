            "text": "KARACHI: Share prices of Islamic banks took a beating on Monday, thanks to Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar\u2019s recent statement that customers are getting short-changed by Sharia-compliant lenders by way of insufficient returns on deposits.\n\nSpeaking to a TV host, Dr Akhtar said the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) should review the issue of minimum deposit rate (MDR) \u2014 a provision that Islamic banks are currently exempted from.\n\nWith every new finance minister in Islamabad comes a fresh wave of measures aimed at shifting money from the bottom lines of banks to the national exchequer. But for the first time in many years, there\u2019s a proposal on the cards that, if adopted, will transfer money from (Islamic) banks to customers.\n\nBack in 2008 when the current finance minister held the position of SBP governor, the regulator directed banks, including Islamic ones, to pay minimum profit rates on savings accounts. Even though Islamic banks were exempted from the provision in subsequent years, conventional banks are still required to pay a certain rate on all savings accounts.\n\nThe MDR is 150 basis points less than the prevailing benchmark interest rate. In other words, every conventional bank is bound to pay an interest rate of 20.5 per cent to its savings account holders as long as the key interest rate remains 22pc.\n\nAccording to Arif Habib Ltd analyst Sana Tawfik, Islamic banks have been exempted from this requirement to promote Sharia-compliant banking in the country.\n\nAmong the three full-fledged Islamic banks listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), the proportion of savings deposits in their total deposits stood at 40pc for Meezan Bank Ltd, 42pc for Faysal Bank Ltd and 25pc for BankIslami Pakistan Ltd at the end of the September quarter, according to Ms Tawfik.\n\nA sensitivity analysis conducted by her brokerage showed that a 1pc increase in the cost of savings deposits will reduce the earnings per share of Meezan Bank Ltd by Rs2.27, Faysal Bank Ltd by Rs1.35 and BankIslami Pakistan Ltd by Rs0.53.\n\nA research report written by JS Global Head of Research Amreen Soorani stated that Islamic banks are currently offering savings rates that are between seven and 9.5 percentage points lower than the MDR offered by conventional banks.\n\n\u201cThe recent sharp rise in interest rates has widened the said spread, which used to range between 300-500 basis points previously,\u201d she said.\n\nHowever, a lender like Meezan Bank Ltd with an outsize market share within the Islamic banking industry is expected to successfully counter the negative impact of the MDR for a host of reasons, she said.\n\nFor instance, it\u2019ll be able to mobilise higher deposits by offering the same returns that are being offered by its conventional peers. \u201cThis would likely boost the volumetric growth of the bank\u2019s deposit base,\u201d she said.\n\nPublished in Dawn, November 28th, 2023",

            "text": "The banking sector in Pakistan maintained robust growth in profitability during 2023, including growth in assets and deposits, the high-interest rate regime allowed them to make handsome margins, increase investment in securities, and lend cash to the federal government at exorbitant financing rates.\n\nOn the other hand, they attracted deposits from customers, providing them with handsome returns too. There have also been major transformations and developments in a few commercial banks, which will impact the banking sector positively in the long term.\n\nALSO READ Bank Alfalah Launches Pakistan\u2019s First Digital Payments Sales and Service Centers Focusing on Merchants and Small Businesses\n\nSome of the initiatives taken by different commercial banks will be followed by other competing banks in the near future. Below are a few major developments that happened during 2023:\n\n(1) Faysal Bank\u2019s Conversion to Islamic Bank\n\nFaysal Bank announced its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank on the first day of the calendar year. The bank converted its assets, deposits, operations, branches, and licenses from conventional to Sharia-based banks and became the second-biggest Islamic bank in the banking industry.\n\nThis transition is said to be the biggest conversion of any conventional bank, not only in Pakistan but in the world, considering the size of the operation. The transformation of Faysal Bank also provided a roadmap for other banks seeking to convert their operations from conventional to Islamic.\n\n(2) MCB Bank Acquires 81% Stake in Asset Management Company\n\nMCB Bank acquired an additional 30 percent stake in its subsidiary, MCBAH Savings and Investments, at the cost of Rs. 649 million. Through this deal, the bank received 21.6 million shares, or 30 percent, of another sponsor, Arif Habib Corporation, at a share price of Rs. 30. Hence, its overall shareholding in the subsidiary increased to over 81 percent from 51 percent.\n\nMCB-AH Limited is one of the leading asset management companies in the fund management sector, and a few companies within a sector are also listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The transition in shareholding will strengthen the position of the bank in the financial sector.\n\n(3) JS Bank Acquires Major Shareholding in BankIslami\n\nJS Bank Acquired major shares in BankIslami to convert the Islamic bank into its subsidiary with ownership of the significant shareholding. The bank increased its stakes in the Islamic bank by 75 percent by purchasing shares from the parent financial entity, JS Group.\n\nThe share swap deal was successful between the sponsors of the Islamic bank, despite being challenged in the Sindh High Court. JS Bank maintained a different strategic position, which will increase its profitability and influence in the banking industry after this deal.\n\n(4) Prominent Banks Plan for Conversion to Islamic Banking\n\nProminent conventional banks with a separate division of Islamic banking announced their plans for full-fledged conversion to Islamic Banking in light of a verdict issued by the Federal Shariat Court last year.\n\nThe banks included the Bank of Punjab, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, and Summit Bank. In this regard, the Bank of Punjab hired a consultant, and Summit Bank rebranded itself as Mukramah Bank. This transition in banking operations will likely attract different conventional banks to follow the same suit.\n\nALSO READ Financial Irregularities Worth Rs.14 Billion Allegedly Uncovered During PSL Audit\n\n(5) Bank Alfalah Acquires Stakes in QistBazaar\n\nBank Alfalah acquired 7.2 percent stakes in BNPL QistBazaar at a cost of Rs. 140 million. The deal can be a win-win situation for both entities in scaling up their business and profitability.\n\nIn addition to the equity agreement, Bank Alfalah, and QistBazaar signed an embedded financing agreement in Shariah-compliant mode for up to Rs. 350 million. Accordingly, the bank will incorporate digital financing products within the QistBazaar platform to offer embedded consumer durables financing in BNPL\u2019s mode.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s move to invest in QistBazaar can prove a stepping stone to strengthening the fintech landscape of the country, as more banks are likely to follow suit for collaboration and investment in fintech companies, which is the need of the hour.\n\n(6) Major Banks to Set up Exchange Companies\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) plans to streamline the business of foreign exchange across the country with control and regulation on trade and flows of foreign currencies, mainly to monitor the stability of the rupee against the dollar. In this regard, the banking industry watched as various exchange companies in Category B shut down while commercial banks were allowed to establish their foreign exchange subsidiaries as an alternate option in the financial sector.\n\nAn overwhelming number of banks made announcements to set up subsidiaries of foreign exchange, including HBL, UBL, MCB, Bank Al Habib, Meezan Bank, Habib Metro Bank, Askari Bank, etc.\n\n(7) Summit Bank Receives Investment from UAE\n\nSummit Bank received a significant capital injection of Rs. 10 billion from its sponsor and prominent UAE investor, Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah.\n\nThe investor subscribed to 3.98 billion new shares of the bank at Rs. 2.51 per share, becoming the major shareholder in the bank. Moreover, Summit Bank plans to convert its entire operation from a conventional banking system to an Islamic one, similar to Faysal Bank. Its board of directors also approved a three-year conversion plan, and the bank has been renamed Bank Makramah Limited\n\n(8) Silk Bank Attracts Investors\n\nSilk Bank, once again, sought the financial support of a strong investor on a long-term basis to fulfill its regulatory requirements of paid-up capital and the sustainability of its profitable operations.\n\nThe bank has attracted interest from MCB Bank, United Bank Limited, International Commercial Bank of South Sudan, and Pakistan Housing Finance Company for investment and merger. At present, these financial institutions are carrying out the due diligence of the bank, which is showing the increasing competition among these entities in striking a deal with Silk Bank.\n\nSudanese Bank and Pakistan Housing Company even expressed their investment plans of 50 million euros and Rs. 12 billion, respectively. With four proposals in hand, it is a good time for Silk Bank to say yes to at least one institution with remarkable experience in local industry and operating a subsidiary.\n\nALSO READ State Bank Fails to Satisfy Panel in Rs. 70 Billion Money Laundering Scandal\n\n(9) Meezan Bank Collaborates to Launch Islamic Microfinance Services\n\nMeezan Bank took the initiative to collaborate with SAFCO Microfinance Company Private Limited (SMCL) for the launch of Islamic microfinance services in the low-income segment of society.\n\nThis is the first time that a commercial bank has significantly supported a microfinance institution. The leading Islamic bank has committed to providing Rs. 100 million in financing and technical support for product development, capacity building, and training for the microfinance company.\n\nThe step will further accelerate the penetration of Islamic banking across the country. The microfinance company established its inaugural Islamic microfinance branch under the brand name \u2018Yaqeen\u2019 in Hyderabad, Pakistan.\n\n(10) HBL to Set Up a Specialized Agri Subsidiary\n\nHabib Bank Limited received approval from the State Bank of Pakistan to set up a specialized subsidiary for the agriculture sector. The subsidiary will work to provide financial access to farmers and other players in the agriculture sector, particularly, but the institution has plans to be deeply involved in the sector\u2019s development.\n\nThe leading bank previously carried out different projects successfully in this sector, which gave it the confidence to enhance its footprints in the food sector with a much bigger role and a long-term profitable engagement. The out-of-box approach of the bank\u2019s leadership might give it a competitive edge in the industry.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) will hold a mock transaction of the upcoming one-year listed domestic Islamic bond, known as sukuk, on Friday (December 1).\n\nThe date of the actual auction of the government Ijara sukuk, which are Shariah-compliant debt instruments based on Islamic guidelines, was not disclosed by the PXS in a notice issued on Thursday, but banking industry insiders expect it to be issued by mid-December.\n\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange building in Karachi. \u2014 AFP/File\n\nSources said the finance ministry has appointed Meezan Bank Limited and three Islamic banks - BankIslami Pakistan Limited, Dubai Islamic Bank Pakistan Limited, and Bank Alfalah Islamic - as joint financial advisors for the potential issuance of local-currency sukuk.\n\nThe sukuk will be open to both local and foreign investors, as well as retail and institutional investors who prefer Islamic finance, they added.\n\nThe PSX invited all broker clearing members and non-broker clearing members of National Clearing Company of Pakistan Limited (NCCPL) to participate in a simulated session for end-to-end testing of the brokerage auction system.\n\nThe government aims to issue its debt instruments through the local exchange to strengthen and diversify the country\u2019s capital market, and the testing of the upcoming sukuk auction is part of the plan.\n\nIn September, thecaretaker finance minister Shamshad Akhtar said that the PSX listing of government debt securities would enhance transparency in the process of issuing bonds, T-bills, and sukuk through public auctions and also facilitate retail investors\u2019 participation.\n\nShe stressed that this move would play a vital role in developing Pakistan\u2019s debt market. The target amount to be raised through this auction is Rs30 billion, according to the auction calendar and instrument details of the simulated session. Buyers will bid for the asset at a cut-off rate determined by the finance ministry during the auction, it said. PSX\u2019s responsibility is to make the auction system available to eligible participants so they can submit bids during the auction. The State Bank of Pakistan issuance price and par value will be used to calculate withholding tax. Investing in sukuk in the secondary market involves paying tax for the entire tenor rather than the holding period, it added.\n\nSurprisingly, the government is issuing sukuk first at the local bourse. Industry insiders suspect that the government is trying to convert its current debt into Shariah-compliant securities because sukuk borrowing is cheaper than conventional paper loans. The government is offering profit rates of 21 percent on T-bill investments, 16-17 percent on PIB investments, and 16 percent on five-year fixed rate sukuk investments.\n\nConventional banks are also criticised for making huge profits on investments in risk-free government papers, especially in the country\u2019s high interest rate environment.\n\nAccording to the SBP\u2019s report, the government has been significantly dependent on bank credit to meet its budgetary responsibilities, and investments in government securities form roughly 48 percent of the banking sector\u2019s assets base at the end of December 2022. The majority of this investment is made up of traditional T-bills and PIBs, which account for 87.3 percent of the Rs16.8 trillion in government securities that banks hold; sukuk makes up just 12.7 percent of this total. From 2020 to 2022, investments in government securities saw an average growth of 28.9 percent. A significant portion of this expansion has come from the recent issue of conventional government securities.\n\nThe SBP intends to convert current conventional banks into Islamic financial institutions. In line with its strategic vision for 2023\u20132028, it intends to do this by creating a roadmap for the switch to Islamic banking and coordinating with banks to make the conversion.\n\nFurthermore, the Federal Shariat Court's historic ruling, which mandates that Pakistan's banking sector comply with Shariah by 2027, has set a high bar for the Islamic banking sector.\n\nOver time, the share of Islamic banking in the banking sector as a whole has increased significantly. The percentage of Islamic banking assets and deposits in the market has reached 20 and 22 percent, respectively, and by December 2022, there will be 4,396 Islamic branches.\n\nConversion of existing government debt to Shariah-compliant instruments seems to be a big challenge for the government.\n\nThe SBP in one of its report stated that in order to assist in the issuing of Shariah-compliant government securities (which will replace the stock of PIBs and TBs), it will be necessary to have a sizable pool of government assets with unambiguous titles to ownership and the ability to provide income. The lack of suitable assets, however, may make it difficult to convert the current conventional stock of domestic public debt into Shariah-compliant securities. In response to the lack of a minimum deposit rate (MDR) for Islamic banks, the finance minister recently made comments and urged SBP to take its application into consideration in order to give depositors in Islamic banking a reasonable return.\n\nIslamic banks are already on a disadvantage due to absence of investment avenues, according to analysts. They sees deposit rate can potentially be linked to a benchmark Islamic instruments (for e.g., sukuk) return.",

            "text": "Passive investing in an index fund is a good way to ensure your own returns roughly match the overall market. But if you buy individual stocks, you can do both better or worse than that. Investors in Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (KLSE:BIMB) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 12%. That falls noticeably short of the market return of around 6.6%. We wouldn't rush to judgement on Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad because we don't have a long term history to look at.\n\nSo let's have a look and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS).\n\nEven though the Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad share price is down over the year, its EPS actually improved. It could be that the share price was previously over-hyped.\n\nIt's surprising to see the share price fall so much, despite the improved EPS. But we might find some different metrics explain the share price movements better.\n\nBank Islam Malaysia Berhad's dividend seems healthy to us, so we doubt that the yield is a concern for the market. The revenue trend doesn't seem to explain why the share price is down. Unless, of course, the market was expecting a revenue uptick.\n\nYou can see below how earnings and revenue have changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image).\n\nKLSE:BIMB Earnings and Revenue Growth December 18th 2023\n\nWe know that Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad has improved its bottom line lately, but what does the future have in store? This free report showing analyst forecasts should help you form a view on Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad\n\nWhat About Dividends?\n\nAs well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). The TSR is a return calculation that accounts for the value of cash dividends (assuming that any dividend received was reinvested) and the calculated value of any discounted capital raisings and spin-offs. It's fair to say that the TSR gives a more complete picture for stocks that pay a dividend. In the case of Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, it has a TSR of -2.3% for the last 1 year. That exceeds its share price return that we previously mentioned. This is largely a result of its dividend payments!\n\nStory continues\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nGiven that the market gained 6.6% in the last year, Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad shareholders might be miffed that they lost 2.3% (even including dividends). While the aim is to do better than that, it's worth recalling that even great long-term investments sometimes underperform for a year or more. Putting aside the last twelve months, it's good to see the share price has rebounded by 5.6%, in the last ninety days. This could just be a bounce because the selling was too aggressive, but fingers crossed it's the start of a new trend. I find it very interesting to look at share price over the long term as a proxy for business performance. But to truly gain insight, we need to consider other information, too. To that end, you should be aware of the 2 warning signs we've spotted with Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad .\n\nIf you like to buy stocks alongside management, then you might just love this free list of companies.

            "text": "Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad ( ) stock is about to trade ex-dividend in three days. The ex-dividend date occurs one day before the record date which is the day on which shareholders need to be on the company's books in order to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is important because any transaction on a stock needs to have been settled before the record date in order to be eligible for a dividend. Accordingly, Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad investors that purchase the stock on or after the 15th of March will not receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 5th of April.\n\nThe company's next dividend payment will be RM00.0422 per share. Last year, in total, the company distributed RM0.16 to shareholders. Looking at the last 12 months of distributions, Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad has a trailing yield of approximately 6.5% on its current stock price of RM02.57. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. We need to see whether the dividend is covered by earnings and if it's growing.\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad paid out 68% of its earnings to investors last year, a normal payout level for most businesses.\n\nCompanies that pay out less in dividends than they earn in profits generally have more sustainable dividends. The lower the payout ratio, the more wiggle room the business has before it could be forced to cut the dividend.\n\nClick\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks with flat earnings can still be attractive dividend payers, but it is important to be more conservative with your approach and demand a greater margin for safety when it comes to dividend sustainability. If business enters a downturn and the dividend is cut, the company could see its value fall precipitously. That explains why we're not overly excited about Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad's flat earnings over the past five years. Better than seeing them fall off a cliff, for sure, but the best dividend stocks grow their earnings meaningfully over the long run.\n\nAnother key way to measure a company's dividend prospects is by measuring its historical rate of dividend growth. In the last two years, Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad has lifted its dividend by approximately 24% a year on average.\n\nFinal Takeaway\n\nHas Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad got what it takes to maintain its dividend payments? Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad has been struggling to generate growth while also paying out more than half of its earnings to shareholders as dividends. At best we would put it on a watch-list to see if business conditions improve, as it doesn't look like a clear opportunity right now.\n\nWith that being said, if dividends aren't your biggest concern with Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, you should know about the other risks facing this business. In terms of investment risks, and understanding them should be part of your investment process.\n\nA common investing mistake is buying the first interesting stock you see.

            "text": "Key Insights\n\nInstitutions' substantial holdings in Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price\n\nThe top 2 shareholders own 64% of the company\n\nUsing data from analyst forecasts alongside ownership research, one can better assess the future performance of a company\n\nEvery investor in Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (KLSE:BIMB) should be aware of the most powerful shareholder groups. We can see that institutions own the lion's share in the company with 73% ownership. That is, the group stands to benefit the most if the stock rises (or lose the most if there is a downturn).\n\nBecause institutional owners have a huge pool of resources and liquidity, their investing decisions tend to carry a great deal of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAs you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad. This can indicate that the company has a certain degree of credibility in the investment community. However, it is best to be wary of relying on the supposed validation that comes with institutional investors. They too, get it wrong sometimes. It is not uncommon to see a big share price drop if two large institutional investors try to sell out of a stock at the same time. So it is worth checking the past earnings trajectory of Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, (below). Of course, keep in mind that there are other factors to consider, too.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad is not owned by hedge funds. The company's largest shareholder is Lembaga Tabung Haji, Endowment Arm, with ownership of 48%. For context, the second largest shareholder holds about 16% of the shares outstanding, followed by an ownership of 13% by the third-largest shareholder.\n\nAfter doing some more digging, we found that the top 2 shareholders collectively control more than half of the company's shares, implying that they have considerable power to influence the company's decisions.\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions.

            "text": "The Islamic Development Bank (IDB), a multilateral development finance institution focused on Islamic finance, has withdrawn its directorship from Islami Bank Bangladesh Limited.\n\nThe IDB withdrew its representative from the board of directors of Islami Bank, according to the bank's latest monthly shareholding report.\n\nHowever, the Saudi-based finance institution has not sold its shares yet.\n\nThe IDB has been engaged with the country's largest private sector lender since its inception in 1983 through acquiring placement shares and holding directorship on the bank's board by sending its representative.\n\nMohammad Al-Midani served as the last representative.\n\nIn 2018, IDB sold 8.69 crore shares of the bank after the massive change in the board in 2017. Islami Bank's other foreign partner, Kuwait Finance House, also sold out its holdings.\n\nArabsas Travel and Tourist Agency, another Saudi-based company, sold its entire holding of 9.99% shares in Islami Bank through the Chittagong Stock Exchange last month.\n\nIn July, Arabsas Travel withdrew its director from the board of the bank. Before the withdrawal, Musaid Abdullah A Al-Rajhi served as the director of Islami Bank for a long time on behalf of the Saudi firm.\n\nBesides, in July, Islami Bank appointed Abu Sayeed Mohammad Quasem, nominated by Armada Spinning Mills, Showkat Hossain, nominated by Kingsway Endeavors, and Jamal Mostafa Chowdhury, nominated by Uniglobe Business Resources, as shareholder directors.\n\nThe three organisations jointly hold 11.07% shares of Islami Bank.\n\nIn June, three companies withdrew their directorships from the bank. At the time, Professor Nazmul Hasan, Professor Salim Uddin and Major General (retd) Abdul Matin were the nominee directors of these three companies on the board of the bank.\n\nEarlier in the same month, Ahsanul Alam, son of S Alam Group Chairman Saiful Alam Masood, was appointed a shareholder director of the bank as a nominee of JMC Builders.\n\nAt present, Islami Bank has one foreign director named Yousif Abdullah A Al-Rajhi nominated by the Saudi Arabia-based Al-Rajhi Co. He is serving as vice-chairman in the bank.\n\nAs of 30 September, sponsors and directors hold 40.88% shares of Islami Bank, which was 42.98% a month ago. Local sponsors and directors hold 30.93% shares of the bank and foreign directors have 9.94% shares.\n\nOther than foreign directors, foreign investors have 26.59% shares in the bank.\n\nMeanwhile, in the first half of this year, Islami Bank's net profit was Tk343 crore, which was 1.36% higher than in the previous year at the same time.\n\nThe bank faced a severe net operating cash flow crisis in the period January-June 2023.\n\nIt said in its half yearly financial statement that the net operating cash flow per share (NOCFPS) had significantly decreased mainly due to less deposit mobilisation from customers by Tk2,541 crore and a decrease of placement from other banks by Tk7,380 crore.\n\nHowever, the bank has Tk17,410 crore as cash.",

            "text": "Readers hoping to buy Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad (KLSE:BIMB) for its dividend will need to make their move shortly, as the stock is about to trade ex-dividend. Typically, the ex-dividend date is one business day before the record date which is the date on which a company determines the shareholders eligible to receive a dividend. The ex-dividend date is an important date to be aware of as any purchase of the stock made on or after this date might mean a late settlement that doesn't show on the record date. Meaning, you will need to purchase Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad's shares before the 15th of March to receive the dividend, which will be paid on the 5th of April.\n\nThe company's upcoming dividend is RM00.0422 a share, following on from the last 12 months, when the company distributed a total of RM0.16 per share to shareholders. Calculating the last year's worth of payments shows that Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad has a trailing yield of 6.5% on the current share price of RM02.57. Dividends are an important source of income to many shareholders, but the health of the business is crucial to maintaining those dividends. As a result, readers should always check whether Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad has been able to grow its dividends, or if the dividend might be cut.\n\nView our latest analysis for Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad\n\nDividends are typically paid from company earnings. If a company pays more in dividends than it earned in profit, then the dividend could be unsustainable. Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad paid out more than half (68%) of its earnings last year, which is a regular payout ratio for most companies.\n\nWhen a company paid out less in dividends than it earned in profit, this generally suggests its dividend is affordable. The lower the % of its profit that it pays out, the greater the margin of safety for the dividend if the business enters a downturn.\n\nClick here to see the company's payout ratio, plus analyst estimates of its future dividends.\n\nStory continues\n\nHave Earnings And Dividends Been Growing?\n\nStocks with flat earnings can still be attractive dividend payers, but it is important to be more conservative with your approach and demand a greater margin for safety when it comes to dividend sustainability. If earnings decline and the company is forced to cut its dividend, investors could watch the value of their investment go up in smoke. It's not encouraging to see that Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad's earnings are effectively flat over the past five years. We'd take that over an earnings decline any day, but in the long run, the best dividend stocks all grow their earnings per share.\n\nThe main way most investors will assess a company's dividend prospects is by checking the historical rate of dividend growth. Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad has delivered 24% dividend growth per year on average over the past two years.\n\nTo Sum It Up\n\nShould investors buy Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad for the upcoming dividend? Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad has been struggling to generate growth while also paying out more than half of its earnings to shareholders as dividends. At best we would put it on a watch-list to see if business conditions improve, as it doesn't look like a clear opportunity right now.\n\nWith that being said, if dividends aren't your biggest concern with Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad, you should know about the other risks facing this business. For example, we've found 1 warning sign for Bank Islam Malaysia Berhad that we recommend you consider before investing in the business.\n\nIf you're in the market for strong dividend payers, we recommend checking our selection of top dividend stocks.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

            "text": "Infographics: TBS\n\nWith the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for the merger with Padma Bank, a fourth-generation lender struggling for survival, Exim Bank shares plummeted below their face value.\n\nExim Bank, an A-rated stock at the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), saw its shares drop to Tk9.70, marking a 3% decline from the face value of Tk10 on Monday, coinciding with the lender's entry into the amalgamation deal.\n\nIn the country's first voluntary merger move, Padma Bank is set to merge with Exim Bank after failing to regain stability despite the government's Tk1,700 crore bailout package.\n\nThe Bangladesh Bank previously announced plans to merge weaker banks with stronger ones.\n\nOn 4 March, the Bangladesh Bank held a meeting with the Bangladesh Association of Banks (BAB), where Governor Abdur Rouf Talukder told bank owners about the incentives to encourage mergers.\n\nBank owners were also pleased to hear about such regulatory relaxation and agreed with the Bangladesh Bank to consider mergers, said a top executive of the central bank who was involved in preparing the compulsory merger scheme.\n\nAfter Bangladesh Bank's announcement, there was a significant decline in the banks' shares in the stock market. Market insiders believe that investors are selling bank shares out of fear that the asset quality of stronger banks may deteriorate if weaker banks merge with them.\n\nShahidul Islam, chief executive officer of VIPB Asset Management, told The Business Standard, \"Whether it will be good or bad for investors depends on how many shares are allocated to shareholders of the weaker bank.\"\n\n\"Additionally, we have to see what types of incentives the authorities extend to the transferee bank to decide whether the merger will be beneficial for investors. If the merger, in any way, becomes forceful, it will not be beneficial for the investors,\" he warned.\n\nOn 27 February, NRB Bank made its debut on the DSE, with shares soaring over 33% to Tk13.30 within three days. However, the shares sharply declined to Tk10 amid merger progress.\n\nAmong the 36 banks currently listed on the stock market, several, including Rupali Bank, AB Bank, SBAC Bank, IFIC Bank, Global Islami Bank, First Security Islami Bank, and Social Islami Bank, have witnessed significant declines in their share prices over the past month.\n\nMost of them are in a risky position, according to a recent Bangladesh Bank report. These banks saw their share prices drop by 20% to 33% during this period.\n\nCurrently, shares in 11 banks are trading below their face value.\n\nOwing to the downfall, the bank sector lost the market capitalisation of around Tk3,126 crore to settle at Tk67,177 crore.\n\nBanks will be categorised for mergers\n\nThe Bangladesh Bank, as part of regular monitoring, will categorise the banks into three broad groups, sound, stable, and distressed, based on a set of selection criteria scores.\n\nIf the aggregate calculated score is equal to 80% or above, the bank will be categorised as a sound bank. This type of bank will be eligible to participate as a bidder/transferee bank in the compulsory merger process and will therefore be asked to submit an Expression of Interest (EOI).\n\nIf the aggregate calculated score is equal to or greater than 60% but less than 80%, the bank will be categorised as a stable bank. The Bangladesh Bank may also consider a stable bank as a bidder/transferee bank, and therefore may also be asked for an EOI.\n\nIf the aggregate calculated score of a bank is less than 60%, it will be categorised as a distressed bank. This type of bank will not be considered a bidder/transferee bank.\n\nAs per the merger guideline, the Bangladesh Bank in December last year introduced the Prompt Corrective Action (PCA) framework under which banks will be categorised based on their non-performing loans (NPLs) and Capital to Risk (Weighted) Assets Ratio (CRAR).\n\nBanks will be categorised based on their 2024 audited financial reports, and the framework will take effect in May 2025.\n\nIn the meeting with bankers, the Bangladesh Bank asked them to take necessary measures to improve their financial health as per PCA in the stipulated period to avoid a merger.\n\nBangladesh Bank governor Abdur Rouf Talukder informed bank owners that at least 10 banks will be merged.\n\nEight banks fall in the \"red zone\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Bangladesh Bank has identified eight local banks falling within the \"red zone\" in the health index, which was formulated through using six distinct ratios derived from the CAMELS rating system: capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity, and sensitivity to market risk.\n\nThe eight banks are \u2013 Padma, BASIC, National, Janata, Agrani, Rupali, and AB Bank.\n\nThis report has been prepared based on data from 54 banks for the past six semi-annual periods, spanning the period December 2020 to June 2023.\n\nThe yellow zone contained three commercial banks (Bangladesh Development Bank, Sonali Bank, and First Security Islami Bank) that were close to falling into the red zone.\n\nBanks that fall in the yellow zone include three state-owned commercial banks, 19 conventional private commercial banks, and eight Shariah-based Islami banks.\n\nThe central bank report mentioned that these banks need supervisory attention due to the relative deterioration of their health in comparison with the industry average.\n\nCondition of banks\n\nThe country's banking sector experienced a steep rise in default loans by Tk25,000 crore in 2023. At the end of December last year, the total default loan in the banking sector stood at Tk1.45 lakh crore, accounting for 9% of the total loans that stood at Tk16.17 lakh crore.\n\nOnly 11 banks accounted for 93% of the staggering Tk24,419 crore in loans defaulted as of June last year. Bangladesh Bank data shows that the capital shortfall for 14 banks reached Tk37,506 crore at the end of September last year.\n\nOne of those, Padma Bank, is now on the verge of collapse. NRB Global, another such bank, transformed into Islamic bank, renamed as Global Islami Bank. Rest of new generation banks have also been struggling to get trade finance even after a decade due to their branding of licensing under political consideration.",

            "text": "Infographics: TBS\n\nDespite significant selling pressure following the removal of floor price restrictions, the benchmark index of the country's premier bourse managed to close in positive territory on Tuesday.\n\nThis resilience was largely attributed to the robust performance of bank stocks, effectively absorbing the market's downward pressure.\n\nMarket insiders say the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE) began the session with a 25-point decline, a day after 23 additional companies were taken out of the price restriction. On Thursday, the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission lifted the floor for all but 35 scrips.\n\nHowever, the banking sector later emerged as a stabilising force, preventing a significant plunge in the key index \u2013 DSEX.\n\nAt the end of the session, the DSEX registered a gain of 21 points, settling at 6,276, while the blue-chip index DS30 saw a surge of 10 points, closing at 2,158.\n\nThe turnover, a pivotal market indicator, at the DSE reached an eight-month high, surpassing the Tk1,100 crore mark.\n\nOn Tuesday, the turnover stood at Tk1,176 crore, reflecting a 13% growth compared to the previous session.\n\nAt the Dhaka bourse, 227 scrips declined, 126 advanced, and 40 remained unchanged.\n\nMarket insiders said investors displayed heightened activity in purchasing bank shares, which had long been restricted by the floor price, during the session.\n\nMeaning that potential investors, who invested in the capital market for the long term by investing in fundamental stocks are back in the market, they added.\n\nInvestors reaped the highest return of 2.6% from the banking sector, with 31 out of the 35 listed banks experiencing advances, three remaining unchanged, and only one registering a decline.\n\nUnion Bank, IFIC Bank, and Global Islami Bank spearheaded the banking sector's upward momentum during the Tuesday market session.\n\nEBL Securities said in its daily market commentary that the Dhaka bourse charged up, ridding on the bank sector, as the investors heightened optimism added strength to market momentum, which pushed the index to post significant gains.\n\nThe market indices rebounded since many investors resumed their trading activity and injected fresh capital into the stock market. This increased demand for many shares that had remained disregarded for a long time has boosted buyer dominance throughout the session, it added.\n\nInstitutional investors, including stock dealers, kept buying shares they preferred at a lower price, and the optimism for a recovery helped avert forced selling in leveraged accounts, said EBL Securities Managing Director Sayadur Rahman, who is also the president of CEO Forum, representing the top 30 brokerage firms owned by banks or other financial institutes.\n\nFunds were initially flowing into large-cap stocks with strong fundamentals, and gradually buying appetite increased for other stocks too, he added.\n\nMeanwhile, the BSEC on Monday evening announced freeing 23 more stocks from the floor price restriction, leaving only 12 large-cap ones.\n\nAfter the removal of the floor price from 23 stocks, most of them faced massive selling pressure on Wednesday.\n\nHowever, most of the stocks getting rid of the floor prices after being stuck there for long were yet to recover to the floor, and that caused a 2.28%, or over Tk18,000 crore, decline in the total market capitalisation at the DSE since floor withdrawal.\n\nThe total market value of all the DSE-listed scrips dropped to Tk7.69 lakh crore on Tuesday, from Tk7.87 lakh crore on 18 January.",

            "text": "Infographic: TBS\n\nStocks rallied on both the Dhaka and Chattogram bourses on the first day after Sunday's national elections, with investors breathing a sigh of relief from prevailing tensions on the political front.\n\nMarket participants say there were uncertainties around the election. Once the process concluded without any major issues, investors regained confidence. However, doubts linger about the sustainability of the market's rise.\n\nThe Dhaka Stock Exchange's (DSE) benchmark index, DSEX, surged 25 points to 6,269, and the blue-chip index, DS30, soared 7.96 points to 2,102 on Monday.\n\nThe market turnover increased by 28% to Tk441 crore at the country's premier bourse.\n\nDuring the session, 119 scrips advanced, 44 declined, and 169 remained unchanged. However, 224 scrips, which account for around 60% of the total listed scrips, were stuck at the floor price.\n\nBesides, all-share price index CASPI of the port city bourse Chittagong Stock Exchange (CSE) jumped 59 points to 18,568.\n\nTop executives at several leading brokerage houses say it is known that institutional investment increased slightly in the market, which has helped the index rise.\n\nThe rise of the index is a significant effect of the increase in the price of some shares in the banking sector, they added.\n\nBanking shares remained stagnant for a long time, but the shares of some banks witnessed the highest price increase on Monday.\n\nThe share prices of some companies with good fundamentals also increased.\n\nIn its daily market commentary, EBL Securities said investors' buying interest was focused on specific bank stocks that they believed would declare satisfactory financial results in the upcoming year-end earnings disclosures.\n\nHowever, investor participation has yet to rebound since cautious investors still clung to a bleak outlook on the market's momentum amid concerns regarding the grappling macroeconomic environment, it added.\n\nOn the sectoral front, engineering issues exerted the highest turnover, contributing 14.2% of the total DSE turnover, followed by banking at 13.2% and general insurance at 11.9%.\n\nBd Thai Food, owned by the health minister's family, topped the turnover chart as its shares traded at Tk24.54 crore, followed by Intraco Refuelling, Sea Pearl Beach Resort, Fu-Wang Food, Rupali Bank, and Midland Bank.\n\nMidland Bank topped the gainer table at the DSE, where its share price increased 9.92% to Tk15.5 each. The other top gainers are Midas Finance, BD Thai Food, Union Capital, and Rupali Bank.\n\nThe worst-performing share of the day was Standard Ceramics, which was followed by Standard Insurance, Aziz Pipes, and Shyampur Sugar.\n\nBrokers concerned over floor price\n\nAt present, more than 60% of shares are stuck at floor prices, leading to a lack of buyers and sellers of these shares.\n\nIn a recent meeting with the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC), top officials at brokerage firms and merchant banks expressed their concerns over the floor price mechanism.\n\nAn official at a brokerage house who had participated in the meeting said market turnover has decreased at an alarming rate since the imposition of this floor price nearly two years ago.\n\nA lack of buyers and sellers has created illiquidity in the stock market. Also, many investors fell into trouble with their margin loans as they could not sell the shares. This has created a lack of confidence among investors, the official added.\n\nBSEC spokesperson Rezaul Karim said, \"The situation of the stock market will improve after the national election. Then a lot of investment will come. We asked brokers to work for proper stewardship of this investment. If the market is good, there will be no crisis of confidence.\"\n\nHe also said the floor price restriction will be removed in a short time, considering the market conditions.\n\n\"If the floor price restriction is lifted, there will be a lot of sales pressure, and funds are needed to absorb it. Already, our chairman has approved Tk100 crore from the CMSF for the intermediary firms. He also urged bank executives to invest more in the capital market. So, there will be additional funds in the market,\" Karim added.",

            "text": "Infograph: TBS\n\nThe country's capital market underwent notable fluctuations in the first half of the ongoing fiscal year, mainly due to various challenges, such as high inflation, exchange rate pressures, and economic uncertainties at home and abroad, the monetary authority said in a statement yesterday.\n\n\"The DSEX, serving as the benchmark index of the Dhaka Stock Exchange (DSE), experienced a slight increase of 0.64%, settling at 6,246 points at the end of 2023, compared to 6,206 a year ago. However, between June and December 2023, the DSEX witnessed a modest decline of 1.5%,\" read the monetary policy statement unveiled for the second half of the fiscal 2023-24.\n\nThe crucial indicator of capital market liquidity, the daily average turnover, dropped year-on-year by 44.80% to Tk543 crore by the end of 2023. This decline in turnover volume is attributed to investors' cautious approach, said the statement presented by Bangladesh Bank Governor Abdur Rouf Talukder at a programme at its headquarters.\n\nThe governor announced a contractionary policy stance, tightening the money supply to tame inflation, which has held above 9% since March of last year.\n\nHowever, the statement did not mention anything about the floor price mechanism imposed by the stock market regulator to curb the steep fall in listed securities due to economic uncertainties.\n\nThe floor price mechanism, implemented on 28 July 2022, has been playing a crucial role in subjecting the market to a liquidity crunch, said a senior officer at a brokerage firm.\n\nAt present, over 60% of shares are stuck at the floor price, indicating no trading of these shares due to a lack of buyers and sellers, according to officials concerned.\n\nSaiful Islam, president of the DSE Brokers Association, told The Business Standard earlier this month that the turnover of the stock exchanges drastically declined due to the floor price restriction. \"If the share price is stuck at one place, then no investor will come to this market.\"\n\nRegulators' initiatives\n\nThe Bangladesh Securities Exchange Commission (BSEC), in collaboration with the central bank and other relevant government entities, has consistently spearheaded initiatives to foster a robust capital and bond market.\n\nThe central bank said in the statement that the government's ongoing mega projects and private investments in the energy, power, and transportation sectors have underscored the necessity for a well-developed capital market.\n\nTo overcome the prevailing economic challenges, the Bangladesh Bank has taken several key initiatives to invigorate the capital and bond markets.\n\nOn 4 August 2022, the central bank allowed banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) to calculate their capital market exposure based on the investment cost instead of market prices for their held securities. This initiative bolstered the investment capacity of banks and NBFIs in the capital market, the statement said.\n\nFurthermore, the Bangladesh Bank updated its guidelines on bank investment portfolios to stimulate bond market growth and expand investment avenues for banks on 31 August 2023. Under the revised guidelines, bonds, debentures, and Islamic Shariah-compliant securities are exempted from banks' market exposure limits.\n\nTo encourage diversification of portfolio risks, BSEC extended the investment duration for securities market intermediaries in listed debt securities and treasury bonds until March 2024 from the previous deadline of June 2023. These intermediaries must now invest a minimum of 3% of their portfolios in listed debt securities and a minimum of 1% in listed treasury bonds.\n\nMoreover, the market regulator outlined specific roles and responsibilities for independent directors of listed securities or companies on 18 October 2023. These directors are mandated to prioritise good governance, sustainability, and the company's overall well-being within the regulatory boundaries set by the commission or other relevant regulators.\n\nCPD survey\n\nThe Centre for Policy Dialogue (CPD) unveiled a study titled \"Bangladesh Business Environment Study 2023: Findings from the Executive Opinion Survey\" on Wednesday.\n\nDuring the survey, the think tank reached 71 businessmen to know their opinions on the capital market.\n\nUpholding the findings, CPD said 50% of businessmen believe that the major challenges in the capital market include suspicious trading in the secondary market, 53.1% think that the BSEC has a weak regulatory enforcement role, 50% perceive anomalies in financial reporting, and 56.3% believe that poor companies enter the capital market through initial public offerings (IPOs).\n\nThe think tank also mentioned that the same issues topped the list in 2022. Other concerns include the failure to ensure due diligence on stock exchanges, anomalies in financial reporting, and the questionable role of institutional investors.",

This BSEC order will come into effect on Tuesday, and will remain in effect until further notice.\n\nOn Thursday, after the session's closing bell, the stock market regulator issued an order rescinding the floor price for all listed companies and mutual funds, except for 35 companies' shares, complying with a long-standing demand from stakeholders.\n\nNow only 12 companies share the floor price. These are \u2013 Anwar Galvanizing, British American Tobacco, Beximco Ltd, BSRM Ltd, Grameenphone, Islami Bank, Khulna Power, Meghna Petroleum, Orion Pharma, Renata, Robi Axiata, and Shahjibazar Power.\n\nAs per the new order, the upper limit and lower limit of the circuit breaker will be applicable to all securities other than the 12 companies\u2019 shares as per the previous order, which was issued on November 14, 2019.\n\nThe BSEC withdrew the floor price on listed securities 18 months after imposing them, in order to bring back a vibrant capital market. The regular circuit-breaker mechanism \u2013 which was in effect before the imposition of floor price \u2013 is now effective.\n\nThat means their prices may increase or decrease by up to 10 per cent a day.\n\nFor newly listed scrips, the circuit breaker for the first trading session will be 50 per cent of the issue price, and on the second trading day the price can go 50 per cent higher or lower from the closing price of the first session.\n\nIn the third session, the scrips will follow the regular circuit breaker.\n\nOn Sunday, DSEX fell 96.50 points, or 1.52 per cent on the first trading session after withdrawal of the floor price. After five minutes of trading, the DSEX index plunged about 214 points but later recovered most of the initial losses.\n\nThe key index finally went down by 96.50 points to settle at 6,240. Meanwhile, market turnover also decreased by 7.6 per cent to Tk 588 crore as against Tk 637 crore in the previous session.\n\nMarket insiders said it was very much expected to fall as a large number of stocks failed to see price discovery for a long time due to the floor price.\n\nThey also said that many investors did not get the opportunity to trade due to the prolonged price level. As a result, there is pressure to sell shares at the beginning of the day, but it is gradually decreasing.\n\nWelcoming the floor withdrawal move, a leading stock broker said the market might see some correction in the first few days. It\u2019s nothing to be feared, and the market will recover very soon, they said.\n\nAfter the session's closing bell on Thursday, the stock market regulator, the Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC), issued an order rescinding the floor price for all listed companies and mutual funds, except for 35 companies' shares, complying with a long-standing demand from stakeholders.\n\nAs per the new order, the upper limit and lower limit of the circuit breaker will be applicable for all securities other than 35 companies\u2019 shares as per the previous order, which was issued on November 14, 2019.\n\nOn July 28, 2022, the BSEC imposed floor prices on all securities to prevent shares from falling beyond a certain level amid domestic and global macroeconomic strains.\n\nThe share prices of most companies have been stuck at their floor prices for an extended period, pushing investors towards liquidating their holdings and thus creating a liquidity crisis in the market.\n\nBack in March 2020, the securities regulator took a similar move to limit the free-fall of shares following the global pandemic, when the DSEX fell below 3,000 points.",

            "text": "Highlight:\n\nFrom Tk100cr IPO fund, NRB Bank will invest Tk92cr in govt securities\n\nIts consolidated net interest income stood at Tk78.69cr from January to September 2022, up from Tk74.12cr a year ago\n\nFrom Tk15cr IPO fund, Protective Islami Life Insurance will invest Tk13.95cr in the capital market\n\nAt the end of 2022, its fund rose 76% to Tk11.64cr, from Tk6.61cr in 2021\n\nThe Bangladesh Securities and Exchange Commission (BSEC) has granted an exemption to NRB Bank and Protective Islami Life Insurance, allowing them to proceed with their initial public offerings (IPOs).\n\nNotably, both companies had augmented their paid-up capital by issuing shares in the two years leading up to their IPO filings.\n\nThis practice is in apparent contravention of the Public Issue Rules, which stipulate that a company cannot apply for an IPO if it increases its paid-up capital by issuing new shares within two preceding years.\n\nIn response to this deviation, the commission has imposed a condition wherein the shares issued within the two-year period before filing the IPO applications will be subject to a lock-in period of three years from the first trading day on stock exchanges.\n\nThis regulatory measure aims to balance the need for flexibility in capital expansion with the safeguarding of investor interests.\n\nWhile the BSEC has already approved NRB Bank's IPO, Protective Islami Life's application is still pending.\n\nNRB Bank raised Tk77.76 crore through the issuance of right shares in June 2021, while Protective Islami Life accumulated Tk4.50 crore in cash in December of the preceding year.\n\nNRB Bank\n\nNRB Bank, a fourth-generation private sector lender, has received approval from the BSEC to raise Tk100 crore through an IPO. The bank will issue 10 crore ordinary shares through the fixed price method.\n\nMamoon Mahmood Shah, managing director of NRB Bank, told The Business Standard earlier, \"We have obtained permission to raise the fund from the capital market during a challenging economic period in order to meet regulatory requirements. Our accountability will increase after we are listed and become more compliant.\"\n\nBesides, the bank will be more capable regarding its stability and expected returns, he added.\n\nProtective Islami Life Insurance\n\nProtective Islami Life Insurance applied to raise Tk15 crore through an IPO under the fixed price method.\n\nIt will issue 1.5 crore ordinary shares with a face value of Tk10 apiece. The company said in its IPO prospectus that of the Tk15 crore, it will invest Tk13.95 crore in the capital market, including government treasury bonds and fixed deposit receipts.\n\nAlso, it will issue 22.5 lakh ordinary shares to its employees, which the BSEC has already approved. These shares will be locked in as per the public issue rules of the commission.\n\nAccording to the prospectus, at the end of 2022, the life insurance fund of the company rose 76% to Tk11.64 crore, from Tk6.61 crore in 2021.\n\nThe total assets of the company grew to Tk37.53 crore from Tk29.53 crore in the previous year, while liabilities have come down 31% to Tk3.39 crore in 2022.\n\nIts net premium has increased to Tk46.71 crore from Tk40.64 crore in the previous year.\n\nAt the end of 2022, the company had settled Tk24 crore of claims, up from Tk23.36 crore in 2021.",
