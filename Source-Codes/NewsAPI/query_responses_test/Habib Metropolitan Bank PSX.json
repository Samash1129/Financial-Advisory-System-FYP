However, the final decision is pending approval from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the completion of regulatory requirements.\n\nRead This: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nThis move is part of a broader effort to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP is implementing structural reforms in the exchange company sector to strengthen oversight, governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures.\n\nThe SBP has also increased the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the added condition that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nHabib Metropolitan Bank joins several major banks, including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL) and Bank Alfalah (BAFL), in their pursuit to establish their own forex companies.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

He is confident that this will send a strong message to investors locally as well as globally that Pakistan\u2019s economy does indeed consist of companies that not only outshine others locally but are comparable to the best companies internationally as well.\n\nThese companies deserve even more credit this year, as does the corporate sector overall, since they have performed exceptionally well in a difficult and challenging economic environment, he added. As in previous years, PSX plans to host an event to celebrate and commemorate these companies.\n\nThe companies that made it to the Top 25 Companies Awards list in 2022, in order of their ranking includes Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited, Engro Corporation Limited, Systems Limited, Engro Fertilizers Limited, Engro Powergen Qadirpur Limited, Engro Polymer & Chemicals Limited, Security Papers Limited, Habib Bank Limited,Pakistan Oilfields Limited, Bank Alfalah Limited, Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited, Millat Tractors Limited, Mari Petroleum Company Limited, Cherat Cement Company Limited, United Bank Limited, Archroma Pakistan Limited, International Industries Limited, MCB Bank Limited, Lotte Chemical Pakistan Limited, Indus Motor Company Limited, Jubilee Life Insurance Company Limited, Pakistan Cables Limited, The Hub Power Company Limited, Cherat Packaging Limited, Pakistan State Oil Company Limited.",

            "text": "The Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) witnessed a buying frenzy on Monday, as its benchmark KSE-100 Index soared by over 1% ahead of the monetary policy announcement.\n\nAnnounced after the trading session, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept the key policy rate unchanged at 22%.\n\nOn Monday, the KSE-100 largely remained in the positive territory throughout the session. At close, it settled at 51,482.93, up by 539.09 points or 1.06%.\n\nDuring the day, power, fertiliser, cement, and banking sector stocks contributed positively as HUBC, DAWH, LUCK, UBL, and MEBL cumulatively added 267 points, brokerage house Topline Securities stated in its post-market report.\n\nOn the other hand, HBL, BOP, and SYS experienced profit-taking, resulting in a combined loss of 68 points, it added.\n\nA report from the brokerage house Ismail Iqbal Securities stated that equities remained positive on an expectation of an interest rate cut.\n\nOn Friday, a bearish trend had ruled the PSX, as the KSE-100 Index closed lower by 241 points. Investors had opted to offload their holdings in the rollover week.\n\nMeanwhile, the Pakistani rupee sustained losses for the sixth consecutive session against the US dollar as it depreciated 0.14% in the inter-bank market on Monday. As per the State Bank of Pakistan, the local unit settled at 280.95, a decrease of Re0.38.\n\nIn a relatable development, the central bank issued a no-objection certificate (NOC) to Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited, a subsidiary of Habib Bank AG Zurich \u2013 Switzerland, to establish a wholly-owned Exchange Company (EC). HMB shared this in a notice to the PSX.\n\nVolume on the all-share index decreased to 286.6 million from 350.8 million a session before.\n\nThe value of shares increased to Rs11.4 billion from Rs10.6 billion in the previous session.\n\nPak Refinery remained the volume leader with 32.4 million shares, followed by B.O.Punjab with 20.3 million shares and WorldCall Telecom with 15.2 million shares.\n\nShares of 351 companies were traded on Monday, of which 232 registered an increase, 100 recorded a fall, while 19 remained unchanged.",
