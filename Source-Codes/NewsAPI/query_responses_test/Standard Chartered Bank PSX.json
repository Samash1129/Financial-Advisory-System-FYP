            "text": "Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Limited (SCBPL), a subsidiary of Standard Chartered Plc, posted earnings of Rs42.62 billion in 2023, up nearly 115% from the profit-after-tax Rs19.84 billion recorded in the same period of the preceding year.\n\nAs per SCBPL\u2019s latest financial results filed to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Friday, the earnings per share of the bank stood at Rs11.01 in 2023, an increase from Rs5.13 in 2022.\n\nThe Board of Directors of the bank also announced a final cash dividend at Rs2.5 per share i.e. 25%. This is in addition to the interim dividend already paid at Rs6.5 per share i.e. 65%.\n\nThe profit is attributed to a significant increase in net interest income and provisioning reversals.\n\nDuring the period, Standard Chartered earned interest amounting to Rs151.85 billion in 2023, from Rs90.43 billion in 2022, an increase of 68%.\n\nAs a result, the bank\u2019s net mark-up increased exponentially to Rs94.16 billion in 2023, as compared to Rs44.6 billion in 2022, up by 111%.\n\nIn 2023, SCBPL\u2019s fee and commission income clocked in at Rs5.52 billion, an increase of over 84% against Rs2.99 billion earned in the same period last year.\n\nThe bank saw its foreign exchange income dwindle massively to Rs5.7 billion in 2023, as compared to Rs9.5 billion in SPLY, reflecting a decline of 40%.\n\nDuring the period, the bank saw total income jump to Rs107.48 billion, up by 72%.\n\nStandard Chartered\u2019s non-interest expense rose to Rs18.43 billion in 2023, up 33% against Rs13.85 billion in SPLY.\n\nDuring the period, the firm reported a profit before tax of Rs89.22 billion, which increased by over 78%.\n\nIn 2023, SCBPL paid taxes to the tune of Rs46.6 billion as compared to Rs30.28 billion in the preceding year, a gain of 54%.",

            "text": "As the final trading session of 2023 approaches, data from the Pakistan Stock Exchange reveals a 54% increase in the benchmark of major shares in rupee terms. The total value of all shares has surged by 39%, reaching Rs9 trillion.\n\nAccording to an analysis by Topline Securities Ltd on Thursday, the best-performing sectors throughout the year include refinery, chemical, and power generation, with respective increases in their market capitalization of 88%, 73%, and 65%.\n\nIn contrast, property, modarabas, and textile spinning emerged as the worst-performing sectors, experiencing declines of 24%, 11%, and 7%, respectively.\n\nThe refinery sector\u2019s robust performance is attributed to positive expectations regarding the refinery policy. The chemical sector saw significant growth, led by Colgate-Palmolive Pakistan Ltd, which announced bonus shares, resulting in a 147% increase in the firm\u2019s market capitalization in 2023.\n\nThe power generation sector\u2019s performance was driven by a rally in Hub Power Company Ltd, witnessing an 88% increase in its market capitalization, while K-Electric Ltd also recorded a 76% increase in its market price.\n\nThe top-performing stock within the KSE-100 index for 2023 was Pak-Gulf Leasing Company, gaining 175%. This less-traded firm\u2019s success is attributed to a dividend of Rs3.50 per share and an 85% bonus in 2023.\n\nAttock Refinery Ltd followed closely, rising by 139% due to low valuation, positive expectations about the refinery policy, and a 49% year-on-year profitability growth in the first nine months of 2023.\n\nPakgen Power Ltd recorded a 123% gain in 2023, primarily due to a one-time bumper dividend of Rs15 per share in June. Standard Chartered Bank Pakistan Ltd and Pioneer Cement also experienced increases, with significant profitability growth of 121% and 262%, respectively, in the first three quarters of 2023. Hub Power Company Ltd gained 119%, partly attributed to a pay-out of Rs19.50 per share and the expected resolution of the circular debt.",

            "text": "Pakistani banks led their Asia-Pacific peers in posting some of the highest stock returns in the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, after a stock rally on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) pushed the local benchmark index to record highs.\n\nBank AL Habib Ltd. topped the quarterly ranking of 15 best-performing bank stocks in the Asia-Pacific featured on S&P Global Market Intelligence in the fourth quarter of 2023. Of the 11 Pakistani banks on the list, Bank Al Habib posted the highest total returns of 89.96% during the quarter. Overall, Pakistani banks occupied four of the top five slots in the ranking.\n\nPakistan's Askari Bank Ltd. took the second spot with total stock returns of 59.48%, followed by Habib Metropolitan Bank Ltd. and Faysal Bank Ltd. with returns of 51.56% and 48.85%, respectively. Indonesia's PT Bank Jago Tbk filled the fifth place with total returns of 43.56% in the October-to-December quarter.\n\n\"We expect the rally in Pakistan stocks to continue due to expected monetary easing, stable currency and improved governance post-elections given the fact that the market is still trading at a low price to earnings,\" said Awais Ashraf, director at Akseer Research, noting that the key stock price valuation ratio is near 3.1 times.\n\nThe \"big weights\" listed on PSX such as energy firms involved in exploration and production and banks will benefit the most from restrictions on the government that the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has placed as part of a bailout package, Ashraf said.\n\nPSX emerged as one of the best-performing bourses in the region in the fourth quarter after the IMF reached a staff-level agreement with Pakistan in November 2023 on the first review of a $3 billion stand-by arrangement. Subject to the approval of the IMF's executive board, the review gave the Pakistani government access to about $700 million in funding.\n\nThe stock rally also helped improved investor confidence amid the government's economic reform initiatives as part of the IMF loan program and reduction in economic uncertainties. PSX's benchmark index, the KSE 100, surged more than 35% in the 2023 fourth quarter to close at 62,451.04.\n\nPakistan's economy is improving, as reflected in its latest gross domestic product figures. The country's GDP grew 2.13% in the July-September 2023 quarter, a sharp increase from a 2.7% contraction in the previous quarter, estimates by the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics showed. The IMF said in October 2023 that Pakistan's GDP is set to grow 2.5% in 2024 after an expected 0.5% contraction in 2023.\n\nPakistan's Meezan Bank Ltd., MCB Bank Ltd., National Bank of Pakistan, United Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank (Pakistan) Ltd., Bank Alfalah Ltd. and Habib Bank Ltd. also made it into the ranking, along with India-based The Karur Vysya Bank Ltd. and CSB Bank Ltd.\n\nWorst performers\n\nChinese banks occupied eight of the 15 slots on the list of 15 worst-performing Asia-Pacific bank stocks by total returns during the most-recent quarter. The remaining slots were taken by Indian, Australian, Vietnamese, New Zealand, Japanese and Indonesian banks.\n\nShengjing Bank Co. Ltd.'s stock plunged the most, by 85.66%, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023, followed by Jilin Jiutai Rural Commercial Bank Corporation Ltd. with a 51.83% drop and Bank of Gansu Co. Ltd. with a 39.66% decline, Market Intelligence data shows.\n\nThe decline in Chinese banks' stocks in the fourth quarter was broadly in line with the performance of the local stock exchanges. The Shanghai stock exchange's SSE Composite Index, for instance, fell more than 4% during the quarter.",

            "text": "KARACHI: Credit guarantee provider InfraZamin Pakistan and microfinance institution Kashf Foundation announced on Thursday the closing of South Asia\u2019s inaugural gender bond.\n\nIn a gong ceremony at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) Chairman Akif Saeed praised the stakeholders for coming up with that debt instrument that helped the microfinance provider raise Rs2.5 billion for onward lending.\n\nKashf Foundation launched the bond earlier this year along with a full credit guarantee by InfraZamin Pakistan, thereby safeguarding 100 per cent of the principal as well as two interest instalments. More than 30 institutional investors have subscribed to the bond.\n\nThis substantial participation from non-banking institutional investors, led by joint lead arrangers Arif Habib Ltd, the Bank of Punjab Ltd, Bank Alfalah Ltd and Standard Chartered Bank Ltd, serves as a positive indicator for Pakistan\u2019s capital market development, an official statement said. The instrument is priced at a three-month Kibor plus a 1.5 percentage-point spread for a three-year tenor. It\u2019ll soon be listed on the PSX.\n\nThe gender bond fully subscribes to the Guidelines of Gender Bond Issuance by the SECP, which are based on the UN Sustainable Development Goals and UN Women\u2019s principles for women empowerment.\n\nRecent SECP amendments have also facilitated this risk mitigation by allowing 85pc exemption to non-bank finance companies for exposures against InfraZamin\u2019s guarantees \u2014 similar to the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s exposure exemptions to commercial banks \u2014 along with other areas of support for mutual funds as well.\n\nThe bond proceeds are expected to boost Kashf\u2019s balance sheet, providing much-needed commercial capital to women from an underprivileged stratum. Kashf\u2019s microfinance lending portfolio will be enhanced to provide finance to 30,000 women from low-income and rural households to develop micro-infrastructure. This will enable them to pursue entrepreneurial aspirations, rehabilitate flood-affected homes, and expand schools and small businesses.\n\nInfraZamin Pakistan CEO Maheen Rahman said enhancing women\u2019s financial capacity, employment and independence is vital for economic progress. \u201cWith this gender bond, we have achieved all three.\n\nPublished in Dawn, December 1st, 2023",

            "text": "In 2023, the banking industry performed exceptionally well. It set new benchmarks and exceeded historical highs. One of the key highlights was the significant increase in dividends, rising by an amazing 84% compared to the previous year.\n\nWith outstanding price performance, the banking sector outperformed the PSX in 2023, achieving an amazing 85 percent return as opposed to the index\u2019s 55 percent. The industry\u2019s profitability enjoyed record-breaking growth.\n\nArif Habib Limited reports that a notable 85 percent YoY growth in interest income was the primary driver of the notable jump in profitability. The policy rate rising by 600 basis points and the year-over-year growth in deposits are two of the reasons for this increase.\n\nRegretfully, banks\u2019 involvement in funding the private sector is still restricted to boosting the real sector\u2019s GDP. Because of this, most banks had record-breaking profits in the previous year and made significant contributions to the national coffers due to their many tax payments, which also resulted in historically high values.\n\nRead More: CDA Mandates Capital\u2019s Hotels to Install Eco-friendly Waste Disposal Plants\n\nIn order to increase their bottom-line revenue, banks intend to create distinct subsidiaries to boost their foreign exchange operations.\n\nThe top ten profitable banks in Pakistan are as follows:\n\n1. Meezan Bank\n\nMeezan continued to be Pakistan\u2019s most profitable bank. Being the premier Islamic bank, it posted an astonishing profit of Rs. 84.5 billion in 2023 compared to Rs. 45 billion in 2022, indicating an 87 percent year-over-year increase.\n\nAt the end of the year, the bank had reached a number of significant milestones, with deposits and assets totaling Rs. 2 trillion and Rs. 3 trillion, respectively. The bank expanded its nationwide network as well, adding more than 1,000 locations and ATMs. A total dividend of Rs. 28 per share was also paid to the bank\u2019s stockholders. Additionally, the value of the shares rose from 25.1 to 47.1 during the reviewed year.\n\nUnfortunately, Sukuk\u2019s extremely limited function in providing funding to support enterprises and entrepreneurs continues to be the bank\u2019s primary priority.\n\n2. MCB Bank\n\nMCB Bank continued to hold the second spot. Its profitability increased tremendously by 89 percent to Rs. 65.3 billion in 2022 from Rs. 34.45 billion in 2022. Additionally, the bank raised its ownership of 81 percent in the asset management company, which made a substantial profit contribution. In contrast to the previous year\u2019s reported EPS of Rs. 27.6, the earnings per share climbed to Rs. 50.1. The bank gave stockholders dividends of Rs. 21 per share.\n\n3. Habib Bank Limited\n\nIn 2023, Habib Bank Limited recorded its greatest profit of Rs. 57.8 billion, a 68 percent increase over the previous year. The bank\u2019s assets and deposits reached above Rs. 5 trillion and Rs. 4.1 trillion, respectively, its highest-ever levels. In 2023, earnings per share was Rs. 39.32, up from Rs. 23.23 in 2022. The bank gave its stockholder\u2019s dividend payments of Rs. 9.25 per share.\n\nIn order to take advantage of new business prospects in the agri-economy, the bank expanded its operations in the agriculture sector by establishing a new specialized subsidiary. Other banks are expected to follow suit. By turning the Pakistan Super League into a national brand, the bank\u2019s leadership upheld its heritage of aiding the country\u2019s interests. Additionally, by giving the IT sector more influence, it advanced the development of Tech Destination Pakistan.\n\nRead More: SBP Reserves up Marginally to $8.05 Billion\n\n4. United Bank Limited\n\nWith a 74 percent increase over the same period last year, United Bank Limited announced its highest-ever year profit after tax of Rs. 56.47 billion in 2023. The bank continued to be generous in its dividend payments to stockholders; in one calendar year, the highest payout amount was Rs. 44 per share. In a year, the bank\u2019s share value rose from 25.4 to 47. By the end of 2023, the bank\u2019s deposits had nearly reached Rs. 2.2 trillion, and its assets had increased to over Rs. 5 trillion. The bank\u2019s management began working hard that same year to establish its currency exchange operation. Like in 2022, the bank remained in fourth place in 2023.\n\n5. National Bank of Pakistan\n\nThe National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) experienced a significant increase in profitability as well, with its bottom line reaching a record-breaking Rs. 53.3 billion. When compared to the previous year\u2019s earnings of Rs. 30.9 billion, the bank\u2019s profit increased by 72%.\n\nThe bank\u2019s assets increased to more than Rs 6.5 trillion, the biggest amount ever seen in the nation\u2019s banking sector. It now has about Rs. 3.6 trillion in deposits. By the end of 2023, the bank\u2019s earnings per share had likewise increased to 24.96. Regretfully, no dividend announcement was made to shareholders by the bank. Regarding the most profitable banks in Pakistan, the National Bank of Pakistan (NBP) remained ranked fifth.\n\n6. Standard Chartered Bank\n\nOut of all the major banks, Standard Chartered Bank had the highest profit growth, rising by 115% year over year. From an all-time high profit of Rs. 19.8 billion in 2022 to Rs. 45.6 billion in 2023, the bank\u2019s profitability increased.\n\nThe bank\u2019s assets now total over Rs. 1 trillion, marking a significant accomplishment. Additionally, deposits increased to Rs. 720 billion. Additionally, the bank\u2019s earnings per share increased by over 100%, from 5.1 to 11. The bank moved up one spot to become Pakistan\u2019s sixth most profitable bank.\n\n7. Allied Bank of Pakistan\n\nOne of Pakistan\u2019s oldest banks, Allied Bank of Pakistan (ABL), also experienced a respectable 91 percent increase in profits in 2023 over the previous year. From Rs. 21.9 billion in 2022 to Rs. 40.6 billion in 2023, the bank\u2019s profitability grew. The bank declared 35.53 earnings per share. After the quarterly results were disclosed, it declared a dividend income of Rs. 12 per share for the entire year. The bank saw a historically strong gain in profits, but its ranking fell from fifth to sixth.\n\nRead More: Railways Accelerate Efforts to Retrieve 13,927 Acres of Land Across Pak\n\n8. Bank Alfalah\n\nThe bank reported a profit after tax of Rs. 36.456 billion, up almost 100% from Rs. 18.206 billion in the previous year. The earnings per share (EPS) has increased from Rs. 10.27 to Rs. 23.12. In 2023, it distributed a total dividend of Rs. 8 per share.\n\nThe bank has established a digitally-enabled lifestyle banking branch. Additionally, it bought more than 7% of the shares in a BNPL company. The bank has achieved two noteworthy benchmarks: one trillion rupees in deposits and one thousand branches.\n\n9. Bank Al Habib\n\nIn 2023, Bank Al Habib recorded a respectable 113% increase in profits. The bank\u2019s profit in 2023 was Rs. 35.3 billion, up from the biggest profit the firm had ever declared in 2022 of Rs. 16.5 billion. The bank\u2019s earnings per share increased as well, reaching 31.7. Throughout the year, the bank gave its stockholders dividends of Rs. 14 per share. In 2023, the bank remained ranked in relation to the previous year.\n\n10. Habib Metro Bank\n\nComparing the Rs. 14.92 billion reported in 2022 to the Rs. 25.2 billion recorded in 2023, Habib Metro Bank also declared its highest-ever profit. The bank\u2019s earnings per share increased to Rs. 23.4 as well. Additionally, stockholders received a notable increase in dividends of Rs. 10.50 per share. The bank was given permission to establish an exchange company as a subsidiary, just like its rival banks.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn 2023, the top 10 banks on the list from the previous year did not change. Surprisingly, the majority of banks held onto their profits positions, with the exception of Standard Chartered Bank and Allied Bank, which moved up from sixth to seventh place, respectively.\n\nThe profit differential between the most profitable bank and the second-most profitable bank is substantial. Several rival banks, including Bank of Punjab, Habib Metro Bank, and Faysal Bank, lost their rankings on this list.\n\nUnusually, in 2024, the profits of two banks\u2014HBL and UBL\u2014showed growth in the face of increased competition. Banks are expected to continue growing their profits in 2024, even with a high policy rate regime. Banks that prioritize diversifying their sources of income and utilizing technology will have an advantage over their competitors in terms of profitability.\n\nFor more news, visit the Al Sadat Marketing Website.",

Surprisingly, most of the banks retained their positions in terms of profit except Standard Chartered Bank and Allied Bank, which switched their rankings from 6th to 7th and vice versa.\n\nThe gap between the profits of the leading profit bank and the second-most profitable bank stands huge. Other competing banks, such as Faysal Bank, Bank of Punjab, and Habib Metro Bank, did not retain their positions on this list.\n\nIn an unusual turn of events, the profits of two banks\u2014HBL and UBL\u2014showed an increase amidst heightened competition in 2024. The year 2024 is anticipated to witness banks sustaining their profit growth amidst a high policy rate regime.
