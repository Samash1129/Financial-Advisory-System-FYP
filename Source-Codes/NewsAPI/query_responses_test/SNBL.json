            "text": "A broker looks at an index board showing the latest share prices at the Pakistan Stock Exchange in Karachi. \u2014 AFP/File\n\nStocks ended slightly lower on Tuesday, as political uncertainty over the President's refusal to call a National Assembly session and doubts over new IMF loan conditions weighed on investor sentiment, analysts said.\n\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange's (PSX) benchmark KSE 100-share Index closed down 0.14 percent, or 86.83 points, at 63,219.10, after touching a high of 63,622 and a low of 63,055.64 during the session. The KSE-30 index however, increased by 9.59 points or 0.05 percent to close at 21,305.82 points.\n\n\"Stocks closed under pressure amid uncertainty over the political outcome of the President's refusal to call National Assembly session,\" said Ahsan Mehanti, an analyst at Arif Habib Corp.\n\nHe added that uncertainty over IMF's new conditions over proposed new loans under SDRs, concerns over high inflation and the hike in gas prices for industrials played a catalytic role in the bearish close.\n\nTraded shares decreased by 43 million shares to 409.962 million shares from 452.868 million shares. The trading value dropped to Rs14.675 billion from Rs16.491 billion. Market capital narrowed to Rs9.089 trillion against Rs9.131 trillion. Of 355 companies active in the session, 111 closed in green, 223 in red and 21 remained unchanged.\n\nAnalyst Naveed Nadeem at Topline Securities said the stock market index wrapped up the trading day at 63,219, recording a dip of 87 points. \"Throughout the session, the index experienced a mixed pattern, hitting a high of 63,622 and a low of 63,055 levels, respectively.\"\n\nThe decline in the index was influenced by OGDC, SRVI, UBL, PPL, and PSO, collectively contributing to a reduction of 207 points. Conversely, TRG, MARI, and KAPCO added 113 points to the index, cumulatively.\n\nThe highest increase was recorded in Nestle Pakistan Limited, which rose by Rs200 to Rs7,780 per share, followed by Mari Petroleum Company Limited, which increased by Rs45.21 to Rs2,316.87 per share. A significant decline was noted in Rafhan Maize Products Company Limited, which fell by Rs339 to Rs8,400 per share, followed by Hoechst Pakistan Limited, which closed lower by Rs61.40 to Rs1,301 per share.\n\nThe benchmark index faces resistance at the 64,000 level, which it has failed to breach in the past two weeks, according to Arif Habib Ltd., a brokerage firm. The index has support at the 62,000 level, which could indicate the direction of the market in the near term.\n\nThe brokerage said the looking ahead, the inflation rate for Feb\u201924 is anticipated to be 23.5 percent, representing a decline month-on-month. However, it is projected that the average Consumer Price Index (CPI) for 7MFY24 will be approximately 28.1 percent year-on-year, compared to 26.2 percent in the same period last year.\n\n\"Although tech names continue to generate interest, broader market participation hinges on clearing the 64,000 points threshold. Near-term support is identified at 62,000 points, providing a gauge for market sentiment and potential price movements.\"\n\nBank of Punjab remained the volume leader with 47.571 million shares which closed higher by 2 paisas to Rs6.27 per share. K-Electric Ltd. followed it with 40.638 million shares, which closed higher by 8 paisas to Rs4.52 per share.\n\nOther significant turnover stocks included WorldCall Telecom, Kohinoor Spining, Pak Int. Bulk, Fauji Foods Ltd, TRG Pak Ltd, Unity Foods Ltd, Air Link Commun and Soneri Bank Ltd.\n\nIn Future\u2019s Market, 315 companies recorded trading, of which 132 increased, 172 decreased and 11 remained unchanged.",

The KSE-30 index also fell by 388.35 points or 1.80 percent to 21,145.82 points.\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) kept its policy rate unchanged at 22 percent, as expected by most analysts, citing high inflation.\n\nAcross-the-board selling was witnessed among index-heavy sectors including cement, chemical, commercial banks, oil and gas exploration companies, OMCs, power generation and refinery.\n\n\u201cStocks fell across the board in the earnings season on investor concerns for economic uncertainty amid pending fiscal reforms on circular debt and ailing SOEs post general elections,\u201d said Ahsan Mehanti, an analyst at Arif Habib Corp.\n\n\"Geo-political uncertainty and the status quo in the SBP policy amid high inflation played a catalytic role in the bearish close.\"\n\nTraded shares decreased by 95 million shares to 317.577 million shares from 412.823 million shares. The trading value dropped to Rs10.693 billion from Rs16.185 billion. Market capital narrowed to Rs9.243 trillion against Rs9.359 trillion.

A significant decline was noted in Unilever Pakistan Foods Limited, which fell by Rs99.21 to Rs2,353.16 per share, followed by Siemens (Pakistan) Engineering, which closed lower by Rs26.37 to Rs597.62 per share.\n\nBrokerage Arif Habib Ltd stated that the KSE-100 has entered into its seasonally weak period, signalling a bearish sentiment. \"The weekly price target of 62,500 was nearly achieved during the initial session of the week, indicating a swift decline.\"\n\nNotable downside contributors included EFERT (-4.14 percent), PPL (-3.91 percent), and MARI (-4.05 percent). Conversely, BAHL (+1.33 percent), PAKT (+3.3 percent), and UPFL (+4.65 percent) provided some support to the index.\n\n\"With resistance observed at 65,000 points, the prevailing bias suggests further downside momentum for the remainder of the week and into February,\" the brokerage said.\n\nK-Electric Ltd. remained the volume leader with 46.691 million shares which closed lower by 30 paisas to Rs4.85 per share. P.I.A.C.
