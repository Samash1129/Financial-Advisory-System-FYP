On the flip side, Mari Petroleum, Fauji Fertiliser Company, Meezan Bank, Habib Bank and Bank Alhabib Ltd lost value to weigh down on the index by 226 points.\n\nAs a result, the KSE-100 index closed at 63,813.06 points after shedding 484.94 points or 0.75 per cent from the preceding session.\n\nThe overall trading volume further dipped by 10.39pc to 412.82 million shares. The traded value also plunged by 35.89pc to Rs16.18bn on a day-on-day basis.\n\nStocks contributing significantly to the traded volume included Pakistan International Airline Corporation Ltd (66.17m shares), K-Electric (47.10m shares), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (31.07m shares), Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (20.13m shares) and Hascol Petroleum Ltd (18.82m shares).\n\nShares registering the biggest increases in their share prices in absolute terms were Atlas Honda Ltd (Rs28.52), Indus Motor Company Ltd (Rs25.42), JS Global Capital Ltd (Rs11.64), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (Rs11.45) and JDW Sugar Mills Ltd (Rs10.00).\n\nCompanies registering the biggest decreases in their share prices in absolute terms were Unilever Pakistan Foods Ltd (Rs400.00), Mari Petroleum Ltd (Rs82.29), Ismail Industries Ltd (Rs44.89), Siemens Pakistan Ltd (Rs32.01) and Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd (Rs25.00).\n\nForeign investors indulged in aggressive selling as they disposed of shares worth $10.05m.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 27th, 2024",

            "text": "KARACHI: As the year 2024 begins, JS Bank, one of the fastest-growing banks in Pakistan, reflects on its journey of progress and growth to provide the best-in-class services to its customers.\n\nIn a year full of memorable highlights, the acquisition of BankIslami was a major milestone for JS Bank, reiterating its commitment to growth and evolution. Together, both banks will continue to operate independently in their respective domains and remain steadfast in their mission to provide best-in-class financial services to their customers.\n\nJS Bank also remained committed to expanding its footprint across the country by inaugurating new state-of-the-art branches, aiming to improve customer outreach.

In 2023,JS Bank\u2019s mobile application usage grew by 72 percent, resulting in a 176 percent increase in the transaction volume compared to the previous year.

            "short_description": "The battle for TRG is raging. Will Zia Chishti get his way again?  Profit by Pakistan Today",
            "text": "Nearly two years after its founder and CEO fell from grace following allegations of sexual assault and misconduct, one of the most traded companies on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) in the midst of an all out war.\n\nThe saga to wrestle control of The Resource Group (TRG) has reached the grappling on the floor stage with the company\u2019s former CEO Zia Chishti issuing full page advertisements in newspapers targeting the company\u2019s incumbent directorate and pleading with minority shareholders to pressure them to call an Extraordinary General Meeting (EOGM).\n\nWhat does Chishti hope to achieve with these tactics? As the largest single shareholder in TRG Pakistan it seems he wants back in at the helm of the company and is rearing for a hostile takeover. As of now the company\u2019s board of directors are managing to hold back the onslaught. But armed with the largest individualistic stake in TRG Pakistan and the support of other shareholders, will Chisti be able to wrest back control? For now the matter has gone to the Sindh High Court (SHC) which has put an end to any immediate EOGM being called. But how did matters get to this point for TRG?\n\nOnce in a lifetime opportunity\n\nIn the summer of 2021, things could not look better for TRG Pakistan. Its shares were some of the most traded on the PSX and as a company TRG was going from strength to strength having just announced a dividend of 44% or Rs. 4.4 in the third quarter of FY 2020-2021. The dividend was followed by the company showing earnings of Rs. 47.4 per share for the year and then gave out another sizable dividend of Rs. 4.4 per share in the first quarter of FY 2021-2022.\n\nTalk to any leading investment company or brokerage house in the country and they would tell you that TRG was a great investment specifically in the technology sector as it was expanding and growing at a rapid rate. The man behind this success was Zia Chishti. Born to a Pakistani mother and an American father, Chishti started his career as an investment banker. He went on to invent Invisalign braces and founded the company Afiniti. Initially a call-center operator, Afiniti started to identify itself as an AI pioneer, saying its software could supercharge the efficiency of call centers by matching customers with agents most likely to solve their problem or make a sale around 2017. On the back of this pitch and at a time when technology companies were getting the lion\u2019s share of new investment, it seemed nothing could stop Afiniti.\n\nDue to his Pakistani origins, Chishti kept some of his investments in his father\u2019s home country. Afiniti is partly owned by TRG (The Resource Group) Pakistan, which was created in 2002 specifically to act as the global holding company for all of TRG\u2019s investments. It was listed on the then Karachi Stock Exchange in July 2003. TRG was the original company that Chishti had founded out of which Afiniti had grown.\n\nThe ownership structure of TRG is highly complex and consists of several layers of holding companies. TRG Pakistan is the overall holding company, but it does not own the entirety of TRG International, which in turn does not necessarily own the entirety of the shares in its portfolio companies. At each stage, there are minority investors who own significant stakes, which makes it difficult to track exactly how much the overall portfolio is worth, and how much of it is owned by the shareholders of the publicly listed company on the Pakistan Stock Exchange.\n\nWhat we do know is that Chishti is the majority shareholder in TRG Pakistan and as an umbrella holding company for TRG\u2019s investments TRG Pakistan is important for Chishti to control his empire.\n\nFor most of its existence, TRG Pakistan\u2019s subsidiary was TRG International, which is a British Virgin Islands-incorporated holding company that in turn owns stakes in most of TRG\u2019s portfolio companies. However, in June 2020, TRG Pakistan\u2019s share in TRG International changed from 57.16% to 46.03%. It is no longer a subsidiary, but is instead, technically, an affiliated company. And while this means that control of TRG Pakistan does not mean control of the international company, it does give Chishti (who also has shares in the other affiliated companies) significant sway over these investments,\n\nBecause of all this Chishti was flying high in Pakistan. He was honoured with government awards and was jetting to and from Pakistan. His company was highly respected and he was a star for Pakistani investors. Until he wasn\u2019t.\n\nThe fall from grace\n\nIt is no secret why Chishti was ousted from Afiniti and then TRG as well. In November 2021, Chishti was accused of sexual assault by a former employee during a congressional hearing in the United States. The house of cards started tumbling almost immediately. Chishti stepped down as the CEO of Afiniti in the United States on the 19th of November and as CEO of TRG Pakistan soon after. He immediately came to Pakistan where an EOGM was called for TRG Pakistan. Despite his best lobbying attempts, Chishti was unceremoniously booted from the company\u2019s board of directors on the 11th of January 2022 bringing an end to his control on his own investments.\n\nBy this point it seemed clear that Chishti was out and he would go into relative obscurity. But he did not take the ouster kindly. Events since his ouster from the board of directors of TRG Pakistan show that Chisti is still looking to get his company back and is willing to be hostile to do so.\n\nA hostile takeover?\n\nEssentially what we have now is an attempt at a hostile takeover, and it isn\u2019t the first time TRG Pakistan has faced one. In fact, it was Chishti who had tried to engineer one back in October 2022 in what was his first attempt at regaining control of his companies. The October putsch was in conjunction with the JS Group which has significant shareholding in TRG Pakistan.\n\nAs a result, a petition was filed by the company in the Sindh High Court in October of 2022 which stated that Chisti, in cooperation with Jahangir Siddiqui & Company Limited with 12 other individuals, was looking to acquire shares of the company in order to take over the board of directors.\n\nIn order to take over the company, the lawsuit alleged that the JS Group was working with its partners to take over TRG Pakistan. According to laws, a group of investors can join together and buy shares of any company that they want. Associate companies, companies who have close ties to the listed company, need to disclose when they buy even a single share. JS Corporation Limited is an associate company for TRG Pakistan\n\nOnce the acquiring company buys more than 30% of shares of a company, they need to make a public offer to the market.\n\nThe public offer brings to light the fact that the acquiring company, in this case JS Group, should have made a public offer to acquire more shares which would have to be announced to the whole market. The lawsuit stated that the whole group had acquired 34% of the shares, crossing the 30% threshold, and had not made a public offer. They had acquired the shares in a surreptitious manner and had not disclosed it.\n\nOnce the lawsuit was filed, the Sindh High Court restrained the JS Group from exercising any voting control in excess of the 30% they had acquired unlawfully. The lawsuit alleged that Chishti and his group were finding ways of taking over the company by circumventing the laws and were also involved in disrupting the affairs of the company by launching social media based campaigns and filing complaints to the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).\n\nThe crux of the matter lies in the fact that TRG Pakistan accused the \u201cChishti Group\u201d of holding more than 34 percent shares of the company while not making a public offer or proper disclosures as they are required to. It stated that JS Group owned 13.8 percent, Chishti with his wife owned 19.7 percent while DGM Securities and Al Habib Capital Markets, brokers for Chishti\u2019s wife, held 0.8 percent collectively.\n\nAfter this move was thwarted, another move was made in January 2023. Court filings again show how an attempt of a hostile takeover was thwarted. The company disclosed to the PSX that the Sindh High Court had passed an interim order on 7th January 2023 to restrain the same parties from creating a third party interest by using the shares of Chishti and his wife. Campaigns against the company itself\n\nChishti has not been sitting meekly in this entire time. And while his attempts to regain TRG Pakistan have been somehow thwarted up until now, he has had the company\u2019s current management under fire.\n\nTRG has had to take out notices at regular intervals denying any social media campaign that is being run against the directors of the company. In order to ramp up the pressure, Zia Chishti filed a defamation suit against the company which led to bailable arrest warrants being issued for the directors of the company. The directors got the warrants suspended in February 2023.\n\nThe defamation suit that was filed has also been suspended with a stay order passed by the Sindh High Court on 20th of March 2023.\n\nThe battle for the company is not only being fought against Chishti but also from within the company itself. One of the directors, Mr. Asad Nasir, has filed complaints against the company to the SECP based on the matters that were voted in December 2021 prior to the elections being held after Chishti\u2019s ouster.\n\nThe company came into focus again when an ad was taken out in the leading publications of the country. The ad goes into detail to make a case regarding the malpractices of its directors and how they are destroying the company from the inside.\n\nAccessing the links given in the ad showed that there was no such website and there is no name or contact information in the ad itself. The site being referenced has come online much later with a group being made on Facebook. We now know, based on a court order filed by TRG Pakistan, that the ads were an attempt by Chishti to unite the shareholders and ask for an EOGM to be called.\n\nThe ad and the new TRG management\u2019s response\n\nThe ad that has been published accuses the current CEO and a director at the company with two other directors of destroying the value of the company while they pursue their own interest. The ad goes on to say that Mr. Aslam with Mr. Mohammad Khaishgi and Mr. John Leone, two other directors, have little stake in the company and have taken \u201cillegal\u201d control over the company\u2019s affairs.\n\nThe ad is targeted at the shareholders who are being made aware that the company has been damaged due to operational mismanagement and that Afiniti, considered the crown jewel for TRG Pakistan, has actually seen a collapse in its revenue and equity value. Ibex, a subsidiary of the company has seen its share price crash by 50% from its peak while the company is using its cash reserves to buy its own shares using an opaque subsidiary of TRG International called Greentree Holdings Limited to allow these directors to maintain their position. Under the leadership, the revenues of the company have halved, even though the dollar has increased in value which should have been beneficial for the company. TRG Pakistan repatriates the income earned from foreign sources from dollars which should have seen an increase as the rupee depreciated.\n\nThe ad also takes aim at the other shareholders who are allowing these directors to stay in their position while the company is suffering due to mismanagement.\n\nIt has been claimed that on September 25th 2023, Mr. Zia Chishti, the largest shareholder of the company, looked to remove all the members on the board of directors and amend the Articles of Association in order to improve the governance at the company. The ad is phrased from the point of view of the shareholders of the company who are demanding for an extraordinary general meeting to be held to vote on the matter in relation to the board of directors. The ad ends with the request to join the effort in order to save the company and to share proxy votes in order to vote the present directors out.\n\nThe letter ends with making a case for holding of an EOGM by the company itself and a special agenda item can be added which would allow the directors to be retired and new directors to be elected. The goal of the meeting would be to take control away from the directors currently running the company and bring in better directors who can take the company back to its past glory.\n\nSpecific allegations being made against the directors state that the directors did not bring back $120 million in cash and $70 million in securities into Pakistan as dividends and used them to park this money into Greentree Holdings Limited which is not controlled by TRGP.\n\nAdditionally, it alleges that TRGP\u2019s voting interest in TRGI has been decreased to 45.3% even though it has an economic interest of 68.8% in the company which is not being disclosed to the shareholders. The company has given away some of its control over the board of TRGI which takes away some majority control that TRGP has over TRGI. The matter of $190 million worth of dividend was left parked at GreenTree Holdings Limited without the approval of shareholders of TRGP. Lastly, it alleges that the company withheld information of any litigation that was filed against which should be known to the shareholders.\n\nThe solution to these issues that has been given in the letter is to call an EOGM and to relieve the current directors from their posts. It claims that the current board of directors is not able to manage the situation and is allowing the three directors to mainly run the company on their behalf. While the directors need to be removed, it is also stated that articles of association need to be changed to bring the corporate governance framework of the company in compliance to Companies Act 2017. The company has not done so and follows the provisions of Companies Ordinance 1984 which has been repealed.\n\nIn response to all of this, TRG has tried to once again put out strong statements against the possibilities of Chishti regaining control of the company. On the 4th of October, the company said in a statement that \u201cany association with Zia Chishti would be highly damaging to the value of the company\u2019s underlying assets, and it is engaged in multiple lawsuits involving unlawful attempts by the ex-CEO to regain control of the company.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is with respect to newspaper advertisements published by Muhammad Ziaullah Khan Chishti attempting to requisition an extraordinary general meeting of TRG Pakistan Limited, with the agenda involving the removal of 9 out of 10 directors of the Company, as well seeking amendments to the Articles of Association of the company,\u201d read the notice to the bourse.\n\nThe small case of Annual General Meeting\n\nAccording to laws of Pakistan, a limited company registered with the SECP has to carry out an Annual General Meeting (AGM) on a yearly basis. The purpose of this meeting is to vote on certain issues and agenda items. Usually, these meetings deal with issues like appointing an auditor for the next year, pass the minutes of any pending AGM and to hash out other pending issues. As a shareholder, investors have an opportunity to put different items on the agenda which can, in their view, benefit the company.\n\nZia Chishti, as a substantial shareholder, tried to add an addendum to the AGM by looking to make M/s. Grant Thornton Anjum Rahman, Chartered Accountants, the new auditors and the Central Depository Company (CDC) the share registrar for the company. This addendum was filed on 18th October 2022 for a meeting that was announced for 25th of October.\n\nAt this point of time, a letter had been attached from M/s. Grant Thornton Anjum Rahman themselves which showed that they were interested in being appointed as auditors. It seems like Mr Chishti had gotten his way. The company was mandated to hold the AGM and had to put these agenda items to be passed or rejected at the AGM. The company outwitted Chishti by filing a request at the Sindh High Court to adjourn the meeting from being held. The Court agreed with the company and restrained the company from holding the AGM till any future notices or orders were issued. On 26th October, M/s. Grant Thornton Anjum Rahman also withdrew its consent to be the auditors for the company.\n\nAs TRG Pakistan is a listed company, one of the main battlefields that has been used by the two sides is that they have looked to accumulate shares of the company in different forms. Chishti group has looked to acquire the shares of the companies by using the JS Group and his wife\u2019s accounts to accumulate shares. This has been thwarted at different stages by the Sindh High Court due to petitions filed by the company itself. On the other hand, TRG Pakistan is using Greentree Holdings Limited. As of June 30 2021, the company did not hold even 1 share of the company. Fast forward to June end 2023 and it holds nearly 156 million or 28.54 percent of the total shares of the company.\n\nThe shareholding is a very important aspect of this battle as both sides know that holding the shares gives them power to vote on the board of directors and the general direction the company is going in. TRG Pakistan knows that an attempt was made in the earlier elections held in 2022 where Chishti wanted to be elected to the board of directors. At that time, due to the damage done to his reputation, the move might have been criticised. Now Chishti feels that he needs to get a hold of greater shareholding in the company to make an impact. Directors in Pakistan are elected for three years. The next election will be held in 2025 and it seems that this tussle will continue till then. Only time will tell what happens until then. But for now Chishti is unrelenting and the TRG management is barely holding him at bay.",

            "short_description": "Here's What Happened in Pakistan's Banking Sector in 2023  ProPakistani",
            "text": "The banking sector in Pakistan maintained robust growth in profitability during 2023, including growth in assets and deposits, the high-interest rate regime allowed them to make handsome margins, increase investment in securities, and lend cash to the federal government at exorbitant financing rates.\n\nOn the other hand, they attracted deposits from customers, providing them with handsome returns too. There have also been major transformations and developments in a few commercial banks, which will impact the banking sector positively in the long term.\n\nALSO READ Bank Alfalah Launches Pakistan\u2019s First Digital Payments Sales and Service Centers Focusing on Merchants and Small Businesses\n\nSome of the initiatives taken by different commercial banks will be followed by other competing banks in the near future. Below are a few major developments that happened during 2023:\n\n(1) Faysal Bank\u2019s Conversion to Islamic Bank\n\nFaysal Bank announced its conversion to a full-fledged Islamic bank on the first day of the calendar year. The bank converted its assets, deposits, operations, branches, and licenses from conventional to Sharia-based banks and became the second-biggest Islamic bank in the banking industry.\n\nThis transition is said to be the biggest conversion of any conventional bank, not only in Pakistan but in the world, considering the size of the operation. The transformation of Faysal Bank also provided a roadmap for other banks seeking to convert their operations from conventional to Islamic.\n\n(2) MCB Bank Acquires 81% Stake in Asset Management Company\n\nMCB Bank acquired an additional 30 percent stake in its subsidiary, MCBAH Savings and Investments, at the cost of Rs. 649 million. Through this deal, the bank received 21.6 million shares, or 30 percent, of another sponsor, Arif Habib Corporation, at a share price of Rs. 30. Hence, its overall shareholding in the subsidiary increased to over 81 percent from 51 percent.\n\nMCB-AH Limited is one of the leading asset management companies in the fund management sector, and a few companies within a sector are also listed on the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX). The transition in shareholding will strengthen the position of the bank in the financial sector.\n\n(3) JS Bank Acquires Major Shareholding in BankIslami\n\nJS Bank Acquired major shares in BankIslami to convert the Islamic bank into its subsidiary with ownership of the significant shareholding. The bank increased its stakes in the Islamic bank by 75 percent by purchasing shares from the parent financial entity, JS Group.\n\nThe share swap deal was successful between the sponsors of the Islamic bank, despite being challenged in the Sindh High Court. JS Bank maintained a different strategic position, which will increase its profitability and influence in the banking industry after this deal.\n\n(4) Prominent Banks Plan for Conversion to Islamic Banking\n\nProminent conventional banks with a separate division of Islamic banking announced their plans for full-fledged conversion to Islamic Banking in light of a verdict issued by the Federal Shariat Court last year.\n\nThe banks included the Bank of Punjab, Zarai Taraqiati Bank, and Summit Bank. In this regard, the Bank of Punjab hired a consultant, and Summit Bank rebranded itself as Mukramah Bank. This transition in banking operations will likely attract different conventional banks to follow the same suit.\n\nALSO READ Financial Irregularities Worth Rs.14 Billion Allegedly Uncovered During PSL Audit\n\n(5) Bank Alfalah Acquires Stakes in QistBazaar\n\nBank Alfalah acquired 7.2 percent stakes in BNPL QistBazaar at a cost of Rs. 140 million. The deal can be a win-win situation for both entities in scaling up their business and profitability.\n\nIn addition to the equity agreement, Bank Alfalah, and QistBazaar signed an embedded financing agreement in Shariah-compliant mode for up to Rs. 350 million. Accordingly, the bank will incorporate digital financing products within the QistBazaar platform to offer embedded consumer durables financing in BNPL\u2019s mode.\n\nBank Alfalah\u2019s move to invest in QistBazaar can prove a stepping stone to strengthening the fintech landscape of the country, as more banks are likely to follow suit for collaboration and investment in fintech companies, which is the need of the hour.\n\n(6) Major Banks to Set up Exchange Companies\n\nThe State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) plans to streamline the business of foreign exchange across the country with control and regulation on trade and flows of foreign currencies, mainly to monitor the stability of the rupee against the dollar. In this regard, the banking industry watched as various exchange companies in Category B shut down while commercial banks were allowed to establish their foreign exchange subsidiaries as an alternate option in the financial sector.\n\nAn overwhelming number of banks made announcements to set up subsidiaries of foreign exchange, including HBL, UBL, MCB, Bank Al Habib, Meezan Bank, Habib Metro Bank, Askari Bank, etc.\n\n(7) Summit Bank Receives Investment from UAE\n\nSummit Bank received a significant capital injection of Rs. 10 billion from its sponsor and prominent UAE investor, Nasser Abdulla Hussain Lootah.\n\nThe investor subscribed to 3.98 billion new shares of the bank at Rs. 2.51 per share, becoming the major shareholder in the bank. Moreover, Summit Bank plans to convert its entire operation from a conventional banking system to an Islamic one, similar to Faysal Bank. Its board of directors also approved a three-year conversion plan, and the bank has been renamed Bank Makramah Limited\n\n(8) Silk Bank Attracts Investors\n\nSilk Bank, once again, sought the financial support of a strong investor on a long-term basis to fulfill its regulatory requirements of paid-up capital and the sustainability of its profitable operations.\n\nThe bank has attracted interest from MCB Bank, United Bank Limited, International Commercial Bank of South Sudan, and Pakistan Housing Finance Company for investment and merger. At present, these financial institutions are carrying out the due diligence of the bank, which is showing the increasing competition among these entities in striking a deal with Silk Bank.\n\nSudanese Bank and Pakistan Housing Company even expressed their investment plans of 50 million euros and Rs. 12 billion, respectively. With four proposals in hand, it is a good time for Silk Bank to say yes to at least one institution with remarkable experience in local industry and operating a subsidiary.\n\nALSO READ State Bank Fails to Satisfy Panel in Rs. 70 Billion Money Laundering Scandal\n\n(9) Meezan Bank Collaborates to Launch Islamic Microfinance Services\n\nMeezan Bank took the initiative to collaborate with SAFCO Microfinance Company Private Limited (SMCL) for the launch of Islamic microfinance services in the low-income segment of society.\n\nThis is the first time that a commercial bank has significantly supported a microfinance institution. The leading Islamic bank has committed to providing Rs. 100 million in financing and technical support for product development, capacity building, and training for the microfinance company.\n\nThe step will further accelerate the penetration of Islamic banking across the country. The microfinance company established its inaugural Islamic microfinance branch under the brand name \u2018Yaqeen\u2019 in Hyderabad, Pakistan.\n\n(10) HBL to Set Up a Specialized Agri Subsidiary\n\nHabib Bank Limited received approval from the State Bank of Pakistan to set up a specialized subsidiary for the agriculture sector. The subsidiary will work to provide financial access to farmers and other players in the agriculture sector, particularly, but the institution has plans to be deeply involved in the sector\u2019s development.\n\nThe leading bank previously carried out different projects successfully in this sector, which gave it the confidence to enhance its footprints in the food sector with a much bigger role and a long-term profitable engagement. The out-of-box approach of the bank\u2019s leadership might give it a competitive edge in the industry.",

            "text": "Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) recorded gains of just 0.4% in the outgoing week as investors awaited the International Monetary Fund (IMF) review and monetary policy announcement next week.\n\nInvestors\u2019 interest was driven by encouraging corporate results, which triggered activity in specific stocks while some results did not meet market expectations, leading to selling pressure.\n\nContinuously depreciating rupee and a significant fall in the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s (SBP) foreign currency reserves piled pressure on the bourse, which restricted the market\u2019s rapid advance.\n\nAt the beginning of the week, the PSX commenced trading on a robust note as it crossed the psychological barrier of 51,000 points owing to investor confidence aided by easing political uncertainties and positive economic data projections.\n\nHowever, the market lost momentum on Tuesday in a volatile session owing to selling pressure arising from geopolitical tensions and anxiety about the IMF\u2019s review under the $3 billion standby arrangement. On Wednesday, the bourse recovered, driven by earnings announcements and optimism about the IMF review, which would lead to the release of second loan tranche of $700 million.\n\nOn Thursday, the KSE-100 index ended nearly flat in range-bound trading as investors\u2019 spirit weakened over depreciation of Pakistani rupee and the decline in foreign currency reserves.\n\nOn the last day of the trading week, the index suffered losses as bears took the driving seat ahead of the monetary policy announcement and due to the looming uncertainty surrounding talks with the IMF.\n\nThe market closed at 50,944, up 212 points, or 0.42% week-on-week (WoW). In his market review, JS Global analyst Muhammad Waqas Ghani wrote that the KSE-100 index closed the week at 50,944, gaining 0.4% WoW. However, average volumes dropped 10% WoW to 366 million shares.\n\n\u201cAbove-expected earnings/ dividends announcement by Bank AL Habib, Fauji Cement, MCB Bank and Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans triggered activity in these stocks,\u201d he said.\n\nOn the other hand, below-expected earnings and dividend announcement by Fauji Fertiliser Company impacted investors\u2019 sentiment and led to a 3.3% WoW decline in the stock\u2019s price. During the week, the auto assemblers announced 2-3% reduction in car prices to account for the recent appreciation of the rupee.\n\nOn the political front, the PML-N supremo returned to Pakistan who cited reduction in government expenditures, increase in tax revenue, rise in exports, IT sector reforms and improving relations with neighbouring countries as top issues on his party\u2019s agenda.\n\nOn the macroeconomic front, as the IMF review was approaching fast, the government became more aggressive in pursuing its economic targets and implementing policy measures.\n\nOn a similar note, the ECC approved the much-awaited increase in gas prices while the budget deficit contracted to 0.9% of GDP in 1QFY24 from 1% of GDP during the same period of last year.\n\nPakistan also surpassed its primary surplus criterion set by the IMF, which was reported at 0.4% of GDP for 1QFY24, the JS analyst added. Arif Habib Limited (AHL) commented that the market kicked off trading on a positive note, driven by the approval of gas tariff hike, a significant step towards meeting one of the prerequisites for the IMF\u2019s review scheduled to commence on November 2, 2023.\n\nNotably, the current account deficit was recorded at $8 million for September 2023, down 95% month-on-month. \u201cThe momentum was further bolstered by the results season, which contributed to the positive trajectory,\u201d it said.\n\nHowever, the consistent appreciation of the rupee ended, resulting in the currency closing at Rs280.57 against the greenback, depreciating by Rs1.77, or 0.64% WoW. Moreover, SBP\u2019s reserves decreased $220 million to $7.5 billion, AHL said.\n\nForeigners turned net sellers as they sold stocks worth $3.47 million compared to net buying of $2.32 million last week, AHL added.\n\nPublished in The Express Tribune, October 29th, 2023.\n\nLike Business on Facebook, follow @TribuneBiz on Twitter to stay informed and join in the conversation.",
