However, this decision is subject to approval and clearance from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and other regulatory compliance requirements.\n\nRead This: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nThis move is part of a broader effort to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP is implementing structural reforms in the exchange company sector to strengthen oversight, governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures.\n\nThe SBP has also increased the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the added condition that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nBank Alfalah joins several major banks, including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), and Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), in their pursuit to establish their own forex companies.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

            "text": "KARACHI: The government is set to raise Rs150 billion through the auction of one-, three-, and five-year fixed and floating rate local currency Sukuk, or Islamic bonds, at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on February 20.\n\nA trader can be seen at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) building in Karachi. \u2014 PPI/File\n\nThe auction will be held for five denominations of Sukuk: one-year discounted Government of Pakistan Ijarah Sukuk (GIS), three-year variable rate, three-year fixed rate, five-year variable rate, and five-year fixed rate Sukuk, according to an auction calendar issued by the PSX.\n\nMeezan Bank Limited is leading the transaction as a joint financial adviser and Shariah adviser for the issue of Sukuk, along with Dubai Islamic Bank Pakistan, BankIslami Pakistan Limited, and Bank Alfalah Islamic.\n\nThis will be the third issuance through PSX, after successful issuances in December 2023 and January 2024, where the government was able to raise approximately Rs30 billion and Rs80 billion respectively.\n\nThe Sukuk auction will provide investors an opportunity to invest in a Shariah-compliant instrument and earn returns of up to approximately 20 percent with investments as low as Rs5,000 only.\n\nIn contrast to conventional interest-based Treasury bills and Pakistan Investment Bonds, bankers stated that the government is diversifying its funding sources and reducing considerable debt costs with the successful issuance of Sukuk through the local bourse.\n\nAlong with this, there appears to be a shift towards Shariah-compliant financing, after the Federal Shariat Court's directive to remove Riba/interest from the financial system by December 2027.\n\nBankers said the one-year discounted Ijarah Sukuk will be under fresh issuance, while the issuance of three\n\nand five-year variable and fixed rate bonds will be against the reopening of Sukuk issued in the January 2024\n\nauction. This will be the first time a Sukuk will be reopened through auction at PSX.\n\nReopening of Sukuk is similar to that of issuance of a completely new Sukuk, where the transaction is concluded by purchasing additional shares in the identified asset, which is then leased out via a separate Ijarah agreement executed with the government.\n\nIn case of reopening, the investors bid on the purchase price of the Sukuk instead of the rental rate (which is the usual practice), as the rental rate is kept the same as announced for the initial issue, which is being reopened.\n\nThe underlying asset, maturity date, rental rate, and rental payout frequency of the reopened Sukuk are kept the same as that of the initial issue.",
