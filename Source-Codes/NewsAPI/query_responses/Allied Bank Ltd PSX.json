            "text": "Allied Bank Limited (ABL) unveiled its plans on Wednesday to establish a wholly-owned exchange company, with an initial capital of Rs 1 billion.\n\nThis significant decision aligns with the provisions outlined in Sections 96 and 131 of the Securities Act, 2015, and Regulation 5.6.1 of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) Rule Book.\n\nThe announcement was made following a board of directors\u2019 circular resolution dated September 27, 2023. According to ABL\u2019s official stock filing, the establishment of this exchange company, with an initial paid-up capital of Rs 1,000 million (Rs 1 billion), remains subject to approval and clearance by the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP).\n\nThis development comes in the wake of recent measures aimed at curbing illicit activities within the black market. The SBP\u2019s subsequent pledge to usher in structural reforms in the exchange companies\u2019 sector underscores the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe core objective of this crackdown was to tighten oversight of the open market while fortifying governance structures, internal controls, and compliance protocols within the sector. The minimum capital requirement for exchange companies has been raised from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional requirement that the capital be free of losses.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that ABL now joins the ranks of major banks eager to participate in this transformative shift. United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), and Bank AL Habib (BAHL) have all recently signaled their intentions to establish their own forex companies. Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had already ventured into exchange companies before the introduction of these new regulatory measures by the SBP.",

            "text": "Allied Bank Limited (ABL) has reported a significant year-on-year growth in its financial performance for the year 2023.\n\nThe bank\u2019s profit after tax surged to Rs41.3 billion, marking a 94.38% increase from the Rs21.25 billion recorded in 2022. This was disclosed in the Financial Results sent to the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) on Tuesday (today).\n\nThis translates to an earnings per share (EPS) of Rs36.07, up from Rs18.56 in the previous year.\n\nIn response to the robust financial results, the Board of Directors at ABL has recommended a final cash dividend of Rs4 per share, which amounts to 40%.\n\nThis comes in addition to the interim dividends already distributed at Rs8 per share, totaling an 80% dividend payout for the year.\n\nA key driver of ABL\u2019s impressive performance has been its net interest income (NII), which rose by 69.26% year-on-year to Rs112.9 billion, up from Rs66.7 billion.\n\nThis increase is largely attributed to a 65.7% rise in interest-earning to Rs357 billion.\n\nThe bank also experienced growth in its total non-markup income, which increased by 19.33% to Rs25.6 billion.\n\nThis was buoyed by a significant 32.3% increase in fee, commission, and brokerage income, reaching Rs11.8 billion.\n\nAdditionally, dividend income and foreign exchange income saw increases of 14.8% and 15.3%, reaching Rs3.5 billion and Rs9.2 billion, respectively.\n\nHowever, ABL reported a 39.7% decrease in gains from the sale of securities, which stood at Rs844.8 million for the year.\n\nMeanwhile, the bank also reported a provision reversal of Rs2.98 billion in 2023, a positive shift from the provision expense of Rs260.9 million in 2022.\n\nOn the expenditure side, total non-markup expenses rose by 19.5% to Rs49.7 billion in 2023, from Rs41.6 billion in the preceding year.\n\nThis increase was primarily due to an 18.5% rise in operating expenses, which climbed to Rs47.7 billion.\n\nAdditionally, contributions to the Workers\u2019 Welfare Fund were also higher during the year.\n\nIn terms of taxation, ABL\u2019s tax payments witnessed a significant increase, totaling Rs45.5 billion, which is 78.2% higher than the previous year\u2019s payments.",

What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nIn a related development, the SBP issued the no-objection certificate (NOC) to Allied Bank Limited and MCB Bank Limited for establishing their exchange companies. Allied Bank\u2019s exchange company will be named ABL Exchange Company (Private) Limited and MCB\u2019s as MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited.\n\nThis move is part of a broader effort to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP is implementing structural reforms in the exchange company sector to strengthen oversight, governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures.\n\nThe SBP has also increased the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the added condition that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nAskari Bank Limited joins several major banks, including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), Bank Alfalah (BAFL) and Habib Metropolitan Bank in their pursuit to establish their own forex companies.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",
