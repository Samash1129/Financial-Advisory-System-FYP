However, the final decision is pending approval from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the completion of regulatory requirements.\n\nRead This: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nThis move is part of a broader effort to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP is implementing structural reforms in the exchange company sector to strengthen oversight, governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures.\n\nThe SBP has also increased the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the added condition that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nHabib Metropolitan Bank joins several major banks, including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL) and Bank Alfalah (BAFL), in their pursuit to establish their own forex companies.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

            "text": "ISLAMABAD-In an exciting development for the capital markets and the economy as a whole, the Pakistan Stock Exchange announced the much-awaited list of the Top 25 Companies Awards recipients for the year 2022.\n\nThese are the most prestigious and coveted awards in the corporate sector and were initiated by the Exchange in 1978, according to a news release here on Tuesday. The selected companies have excelled on the basis of their financial performance, governance, and operational achievements, as well as sustainability and ESG-related initiatives. They truly are leaders in all respects in Pakistan\u2019s corporate sector.\n\nThe PSX Top 25 Companies Awards recognise companies achieving certain key pre-requisites for this prestigious award, which include having a minimum dividend distribution of 30 percent and shares of the company having been traded at least 75 percent of the total trading days in a year, among other pre-requisites. Subject to achieving these pre-requisites, the companies are further weighed based on certain quantitative and qualitative criteria. In terms of quantitative criteria, PSX selects listed companies which have performed exceptionally in the context of profitability ratios, dividend related ratios, and turnover of shares, among other specifics.\n\nIn terms of qualitative criteria, PSX selected high-performing listed companies based on corporate social responsibility (CSR), reporting on SDGs, ESG-related initiatives, and diversity and inclusivity, among other considerations. Announcing the PSX Top 25 Companies names for 2022, the MD and CEO of PSX, Farrukh H Khan, stated, \u201cOn behalf of the Pakistan Stock Exchange, I extend my warmest congratulations to the recipients of the PSX Top 25 Companies Awards 2022.\n\nIn the current challenging economic circumstances, the announcement of the PSX Top 25 Companies Awards is very welcome news.\u201d He said these awards showcase the best of Pakistan\u2019s corporate, business, and industrial companies. He is confident that this will send a strong message to investors locally as well as globally that Pakistan\u2019s economy does indeed consist of companies that not only outshine others locally but are comparable to the best companies internationally as well.\n\nThese companies deserve even more credit this year, as does the corporate sector overall, since they have performed exceptionally well in a difficult and challenging economic environment, he added. As in previous years, PSX plans to host an event to celebrate and commemorate these companies. The companies that made it to the Top 25 Companies Awards list in 2022, in order of their ranking includes Fauji Fertilizer Company Limited, Engro Corporation Limited, Systems Limited, Engro Fertilizers Limited, Engro Powergen Qadirpur Limited, Engro Polymer & Chemicals Limited, Security Papers Limited, Habib Bank Limited, Pakistan Oilfields Limited, Bank Alfalah Limited, Habib Metropolitan Bank Limited, Millat Tractors Limited, Mari Petroleum Company Limited, Cherat Cement Company Limited, United Bank Limited, Archroma Pakistan Limited, International Industries Limited, MCB Bank Limited, Lotte Chemical Pakistan Limited, Indus Motor Company Limited, Jubilee Life Insurance Company Limited, Pakistan Cables Limited, The Hub Power Company Limited, Cherat Packaging Limited, Pakistan State Oil Company Limited.",
