            "text": "Shares at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) trended upward on Wednesday, with the benchmark KSE-100 index surging past 300 points.\n\nThe index gained 323.03 points, or 0.69 per cent, closing at 47,079.83 points from the previous close of 46,756.80 points.\n\nThe index as of 11:30am.\u2014Screenshot courtesy PSX\n\nMeanwhile, the rupee has continued to improve against the dollar for the 20th consecutive session, gaining Rs1.04. By closing time, the US dollar stood at Rs284.68 in the interbank, according to State Bank of Pakistan. In the open market, the dollar depreciated by Rs1, trading for Rs285.\n\n10pc tax on Afghan transit trade has helped\n\nAli Malik, chief executive of brokerage firm First National Equities, attributed the bullish behaviour to the \u201ccontinuous and focused attention\u201d the Special Investment Facilitation Council (SIFC) \u2014 a body comprising senior civil and military officials formed to attract foreign investment \u2014 was paying to the current economic woes.\n\nMoreover, Malik said, the rupee appreciation over the past few weeks has given investors \u201cless to worry about\u201d.\n\n\u201cSecondly, the 10pc duty on Afghanistan transit trade is going to discourage any kind of smuggling which used to take place through Afghan transit,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cGoods from outside used to come through Afghanistan to get sold in Pakistan. Now, smuggling will be discouraged which will further empower local industry,\u201d he added.\n\nMalik said tax collection was \u201cgood now\u201d, the parameters are satisfactory. \u201cAs investor confidence increases, so will the share price,\u201d he added.\n\nSiddique Dalal, chief executive of Karachi-based brokerage firm Dalal Securities, noted the crackdown against smuggling, the recent rupee appreciation rally, the talk about stricter immigration laws and the SIFC receiving investments from Saudi Arabia to be major reasons for the upward trend in the index.\n\nHowever, he added: \u201cAcross the board is not that good. Banks are performing well today, yesterday it was cement. The volume is not there.\n\n\u201cIn addition, the World Bank projected a slumping GDP growth. Some things are not that good. However, it has hit the 47,000 mark, the main reason is rupee appreciation, crackdown, changes in immigration laws [and] curbing smuggling, so there is an increase in investor confidence.\u201d\n\n\u2018Banks doing well, but volume is still low\u2019\n\nSalman Naqvi, head of research at Aba Ali Habib Securities, said the main activity was in the banks due to them releasing their quarterly results which are expected to be positive, particularly in banks like Meezan Bank, United Bank Limited, and Muslim Commercial Bank.\n\n\u201cApart from this, there is a possibility of gas prices increasing so that\u2019s why there is an increase in shares of PPL (Pakistan Petroleum Limited), OGDC (Oil and Gas Development Company) and Sui North.\n\nFurthermore, he said there is a likelihood that the dividends scheme sent to the IMF will be approved and therefore the power sector \u201cwill see some positive developments ahead\u201d.\n\nNaqvi also credited the stock rally to the rupee appreciation, the Pakistani investment bond yield, and the current account deficit improvement.\n\n\u201cHowever, volume is still low, there is a cautious approach to this.\u201d",

            "text": "The government raised Rs479 billion through the sale of one-year Ijarah Sukuk at the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), attracting 16 times more than the target amount of Rs30 billion.\n\nThe event was attended by caretaker Prime Minister Anwaarul Haq Kakar, caretaker Finance Minister Dr Shamshad Akhtar, and PSX MD and CEO Farrukh H Khan, among others.\n\nThe PM said the auction was a remarkable achievement for the entire market ecosystem and reflected the confidence of investors in the economy. He said the government had addressed the structural and macroeconomic issues and improved the fiscal and external accounts.\n\nThe auction marked the first time that the Ministry of Finance conducted a primary market auction of government debt securities at the PSX, in addition to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).\n\nThe cut-off yield for the Sukuk was below 20%, which was significantly lower than the average 22% return on one-year T-bills. The auction was aimed at simplifying the participation in government securities, diversifying the investor base, and enhancing transparency.\n\nThe finance minister said the auction was a momentous occasion for the financial markets and the economy of Pakistan. She said the amendment to existing rules had enabled the raising of government debt in capital markets.\n\nThe PSX chief said the auction would augment efficiency, flexibility, registration, trading and transfer of the government debt securities.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, the PSX announced it would hold the first-ever auction of listed government Ijara Sukuk bonds in a bid to raise Rs90 billion from the sale of one-year Islamic bonds between December 2023 and February 2024. The bonds are based on the Shariah-compliant principle of Ijarah, which involves the leasing of assets.\n\nThe auction was said to be held through the Capital Market Infrastructure Institutions (CMIIs), which include the PSX, the National Clearing and Settlement Company of Pakistan (NCCPL), and the Central Depository Company of Pakistan (CDC).\n\nThe Ministry of Finance had recently approved some amendments to the rules governing the issuance, registration, trading, and transfer of government debt securities through the CMIIs, allowing the PSX to conduct the primary market issuance.\n\nNow, the second auction will be held on January 23, with the same target of Rs30 billion, and settlement on January 24, 2023. The third and final auction will be held in February 2024, with a target of Rs30 billion and settlement on the same day as the auction date.",

            "text": "Faysal Bank Limited (PSX: FABL) announced on Thursday to set up a fully-owned exchange company with an initial capital injection of Rs 1 billion.\n\nThis move aligns with the provisions outlined in Sections 96 and 131 of the Securities Act, 2015, and Regulation 5.6.1 of the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) Rule Book.\n\nDuring a board meeting held on September 27, 2023, Faysal Bank Limited\u2019s board of directors approved the establishment of an exchange company, starting with an initial paid-up capital of Rs 1 billion, pending clearance and approval from the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP), bank\u2019s filing in the Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) said.\n\nThis development follows recent efforts to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP has pledged to institute structural reforms in the exchange company sector, emphasizing the gravity of the situation.\n\nThe primary aim of this crackdown is to enhance oversight of the open market and strengthen governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures within the sector. The minimum capital requirement for exchange companies has been raised from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the additional requirement that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nIt\u2019s noteworthy that Faysal Bank Limited joins the ranks of major banks keen on participating in this transformative shift. United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), and Allied Bank Limited (ABL) have all recently indicated their intentions to establish their own forex companies.\n\nHabib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had already ventured into exchange companies before the introduction of these new regulatory measures by the SBP.",
