            "text": "KARACHI: The equities market turned in a robust performance in the first outgoing week of the new calendar year thanks to positive developments on the economic front.\n\nArif Habib Ltd said the stock market displayed notable resilience, experiencing a significant surge of 2,211 points on Monday, recording the second-highest absolute point increase and marking the highest surge on the first working day of a new year.\n\nMoreover, positive economic indicators were evident as the Federal Board of Revenue achieved a historic one-month tax collection of Rs984bn, coupled with a substantial 40.1 per cent year-on-year reduction in the trade deficit for December 2023. However, an elevated level of headline inflation number of December at 29.7pc year-on-year raised some investor concerns.\n\nOn a positive note, the State Bank of Pakistan\u2019s reserves reached $8.2bn, the highest level since July 14, 2023. Moreover, the rupee strengthened by 0.16pc against the US dollar, clocking in at Rs281.4.\n\nHence, the KSE-100 index closed at 64,515 points after gaining 2,064 points or 3.3pc week-on-week.\n\nSector-wise positive contributions came from oil and gas exploration companies (587 points), commercial banks (392 points), fertiliser (315 points), cement (185 points), and power generation and distribution (166 points). Sectors that contributed negatively were miscellaneous (13 points), glass & ceramics (3.2 points), investment banks (1.3 points), modarbas (one point) and leasing companies (0.1 points).\n\nScrip-wise positive contributors were Pakistan Petroleum Ltd (268 points), Oil and Gas Development Company Ltd (258 points), Fauji Fertiliser Company (151 points), Hub Power Company Ltd (120 points), and United Bank Ltd (102 points). Meanwhile, scrip-wise negative contributions came from Pakistan Aluminium Beverage Cans Ltd (12 points), Askari Bank Ltd (6 points), Ghani Glass Ltd (4.8 points), Lucky Core Industries Ltd (4.5 points), and BankIslami Pakistan Ltd (3.6 points).\n\nForeign selling clocked in at $3.1m compared to $1.9m in the preceding week. Major selling was witnessed in exploration and production ($1.95m) and banks ($1m).\n\nOn the local front, buying was reported by other organisations ($5.5m) and banks ($5.4m). Average daily volume arrived at 687m shares, up by 5.4pc week-on-week. The average daily value settled at $69.6m, up by 11.6pc from the preceding week.\n\nTopline Securities Ltd observed that the surge in the benchmark KSE 100-share can largely be attributed to aggressive institutional buying after the IMF announced its executive board is meeting on Jan 11 to approve $700m tranche for Pakistan.\n\nGoing forward, AKD Securities Ltd said the market is anticipated to maintain its bullish momentum, fuelled by the disbursement of the IMF second tranche. The forthcoming elections will be closely watched, and uncertainty surrounding their outcome could potentially hinder the market\u2019s bullish trend.\n\nHowever, a peaceful resolution could provide a significant boost to investor confidence. Our recommendation to investors is to maintain long-term positions in companies with strong fundamentals while tactfully managing any fundamentally weak entities through a timely profit-taking strategy.\n\nAdditionally, companies offering robust dividend yields, especially in the banking, energy, and fertiliser sectors, present opportunities for accumulation, noted AKD Securities.\n\nPublished in Dawn, January 7th, 2024",

            "text": "Read This: Big banks are all set to run the open market. What does it solve and what it doesn\u2019t\n\nIn a related development, the SBP issued the no-objection certificate (NOC) to Allied Bank Limited and MCB Bank Limited for establishing their exchange companies. Allied Bank\u2019s exchange company will be named ABL Exchange Company (Private) Limited and MCB\u2019s as MCB Exchange Company (Private) Limited.\n\nThis move is part of a broader effort to combat illicit activities in the black market. The SBP is implementing structural reforms in the exchange company sector to strengthen oversight, governance structures, internal controls, and compliance procedures.\n\nThe SBP has also increased the minimum capital requirement for exchange companies from Rs 200 million to Rs 500 million, with the added condition that the capital must be free of losses.\n\nAskari Bank Limited joins several major banks, including United Bank Limited (UBL), Meezan Bank, MCB Bank Limited (MCB), Bank AL Habib (BAHL), Allied Bank Limited (ABL), Faysal Bank Limited (FABL), Bank Alfalah (BAFL) and Habib Metropolitan Bank in their pursuit to establish their own forex companies.\n\nNotably, Habib Bank Limited (HBL) and the National Bank of Pakistan (NPB) had ventured into exchange companies before the implementation of these new SBP regulatory measures.",

            "text": "Early on Monday morning, a major development occurred in the banking sector. MCB Bank Limited (MCB) has expressed interest in one of the smallest banks of Pakistan, Silkbank Limited MCB informed Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) that its Board of Directors (BoD) has given a green signal to the management to conduct due diligence of Silkbank Limited.\n\nThis \u2018due diligence\u2019 will set the course for MCB\u2019s future actions as the bank stated that the potential transaction is subject to favourable outcomes of due diligence, internal and regulatory approvals and definitive documents.\n\nOrganisations that expressed interest in Silkbank\n\nMCB Bank is the fourth party that has expressed interest in SilkBank in recent times.\n\nIn April, the International Commercial Bank (ICB), a South Sudanese bank, expressed its intention to invest up to 50 million euros (equivalent to Rs 15.4 billion) in Silkbank.\n\nLater on, Pakistan Housing Finance Company (PHFC), a subsidiary of Lake City Limited and a leading consortium of an investor group, supported and backed by the renowned management of Burj Capital, which carries the required experience of setting up and successfully managing Islamic and conventional banks in Pakistan, proposed an investment of up to Rs 12 billion into Silkbank Limited\u2019s equity.\n\nOn May 2, 2023 United Bank Limited (UBL) announced its intention to formally pursue a potential merger with SilkBank.\n\nPreviously in early 2021, Fauji Foundation, which has a stake in Askari Bank, expressed interest to acquire a major stake in Silk Bank. When it lost interest, Habib Bank and Bank Alfalah became interested in acquiring Silk Bank\u2019s consumer portfolio in mid-2021. In May 2022, Park View Enclave (Private) Limited, owned by businessman and politician Aleem Khan, expressed interest in acquiring 51% of the stake in Silk Bank which also withdrew its intention in October 2022, citing a change in its business priorities.\n\nWhat is in it for MCB (and other investors that have expressed their interest in the Bank)?\n\nSilkbank, formerly the Saudi-Pak Commercial Bank, is primarily focused on the consumer segment with a portfolio of services consisting of consumer loans, and credit cards. The smallest bank of Pakistan manages a good credit card and personal loan portfolio and has sound Shariah-compliant products. MCB could expand its outreach by merging with Silkbank. It could merge its Islamic banking operations with Silkbank to appease the ever-growing demand for Sharia-compliant financial products.\n\nWhat is in it for Silkbank?\n\nSilkbank has been making losses for a few years now. The bank reported a profit of Rs 13.2 billion in 2018. Thereafter, it reported a net loss of Rs 3.95 billion in 2019 which increased to Rs 6.57 billion at the end of 2020. Its accumulated losses amounted to Rs 20.27 billion at the end of 2020, the latest period for which the bank has published its financial accounts.\n\nIts capital stood at Rs 3.16 billion against the prescribed minimum capital requirement of Rs 10 billion at the end of 2020. Similarly, its capital adequacy ratio was -4.45% against the prescribed level of 11.5% on Dec 31, 2020.\n\nThe bank is in desperate need of new capital to meet regulatory requirements. Earlier this year, Silkbank said in a press release that the bank is on a growth trajectory. But annual reports have not been made available to the public.",
